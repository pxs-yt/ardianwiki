# Renewable Energy

**Renewable energy** harnesses naturally replenishing resources—solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass—to generate power with minimal environmental impact. By March 01, 2025, it supplies 35% of global electricity (12,000 TWh/year), driven by climate goals (e.g., Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C target) and technological leaps. Unlike fossil fuels, renewables emit near-zero greenhouse gases during operation, though their lifecycle (manufacturing, disposal) poses challenges.

## Types of Renewable Energy

### Solar Energy

Solar power captures sunlight via photovoltaic (PV) cells or concentrated solar power (CSP):
- **PV**: Silicon cells convert 15–22% of sunlight into electricity (2025 efficiency peaks at 25%). Global capacity: 1,500 GW.
- **CSP**: Mirrors focus sunlight to heat fluids (600°C), driving turbines. Largest plant: Morocco’s Noor (580 MW).

Solar output varies—1 kW/m² at peak, dropping 50% under clouds. Panels last 25–30 years, with 95% recyclability.

### Wind Energy

Wind turbines convert kinetic energy into electricity:
- **Onshore**: Towers (100–150 m) with 2–5 MW turbines dot plains (e.g., Texas, 40 GW).
- **Offshore**: Floating turbines (15 MW, 260 m rotors) tap stronger winds (e.g., North Sea, 50 GW).

Global capacity: 1,200 GW, generating 2,500 TWh/year. Winds of 6–12 m/s are optimal, with cut-off at 25 m/s.

### Hydropower

Water flow spins turbines:
- **Dams**: Hoover Dam (2 GW) stores 35 km³, powering 1.3 million homes.
- **Run-of-River**: Smaller systems (10–100 MW) minimize ecological disruption.

Hydropower supplies 16% of global electricity (4,500 TWh), with 1,300 GW installed. Efficiency: 90%, the highest among renewables.

### Geothermal Energy

Heat from Earth’s core (5,500°C at 6,371 km depth) drives steam turbines:
- **High-Temperature**: Iceland’s Hellisheiði (303 MW) taps 300°C reservoirs.
- **Low-Temperature**: Heat pumps (20 kW) warm homes at 50°C.

Capacity: 15 GW globally, with potential for 200 GW by 2050.

### Biomass Energy

Organic matter—wood, crops, waste—burns or ferments for power:
- **Direct Combustion**: 50 GW from wood pellets (e.g., Drax, UK).
- **Biofuels**: Ethanol (120 billion liters/year) from corn powers 10% of vehicles.

Biomass adds 300 TWh/year, though CO₂ neutrality depends on regrowth rates.

## History

Renewables predate fossil fuels:
- **Pre-Industrial**: Windmills (1 kW, 12th century) ground grain; waterwheels (10 kW) ran mills.
- **19th Century**: Solar ovens (1860s) hit 200°C; hydropower dams (1882) lit towns.
- **20th Century**: Wind turbines (1 MW, 1941) and PV cells (4% efficiency, 1954) emerged.
- **21st Century**: Costs fell—solar from $4/W (2000) to $0.20/W (2025), wind to $0.03/kWh—spurring 10% annual growth.

## Technology and Efficiency

- **Solar Panels**: Monocrystalline (22% efficiency) outperform polycrystalline (18%). Bifacial panels capture 10% more via reflection.
- **Wind Turbines**: Blade lengths doubled (50 m to 130 m since 2000), boosting capacity factors from 25% to 45%.
- **Hydro Turbines**: Kaplan designs adjust blades, hitting 95% efficiency at 10 m/s flow.
- **Geothermal**: Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) drill 5 km, raising output 20% over traditional wells.

Storage—lithium-ion batteries (300 Wh/kg)—pairs with renewables, smoothing intermittency (e.g., Tesla’s 500 MW Hornsdale stabilizes grids).

## Economic Impact

Renewables employ 15 million globally (2025):
- **Solar**: 5 million jobs, $200 billion market.
- **Wind**: 2 million, $150 billion.
- **Hydro**: 1.5 million, $100 billion.

Subsidies ($200 billion/year) and tax breaks drive adoption, with LCOE (Levelized Cost of Energy) at $30–50/MWh, undercutting coal ($60/MWh).

## Environmental Benefits and Challenges

- **Benefits**: Cuts CO₂ by 10 Gt/year (25% of emissions). Solar farms boost biodiversity if grazed (e.g., 10% more pollinators).
- **Challenges**: PV manufacturing emits 50 g CO₂/kWh; turbine blades (50 tons) clog landfills. Rare earth mining (neodymium, 1 kg/kW for wind) scars landscapes.

## Policy and Future Trends

- **Policy**: The EU’s 55% emissions cut by 2030 funds 1,000 GW of renewables. China’s 2060 net-zero goal adds 50 GW/year.
- **Trends**: Floating solar (10 GW, 2025) taps reservoirs; green hydrogen (10 Mt/year) stores excess power. By 2050, renewables may hit 80% of power (30,000 TWh).

## Cultural Significance

Renewables inspire eco-art (e.g., Olafur Eliasson’s solar installations) and shift energy geopolitics—solar-rich nations like Chile rival oil states.
