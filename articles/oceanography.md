# Oceanography

**Oceanography** is the scientific study of Earth’s oceans, covering their physical, chemical, biological, and geological properties. Covering 71% of the planet’s surface (361 million km²), oceans hold 1.332 billion km³ of water, averaging 3,688 m deep, and drive climate, ecosystems, and human economies. As of March 01, 2025, oceanography leverages satellites, submersibles, and AI to explore this vast frontier, from the sunlit surface to the 11 km abyss.

## Branches of Oceanography

### Physical Oceanography

Studies ocean physics:
- **Currents**: The Gulf Stream moves 100 Sv (10⁶ m³/s), warming Europe by 5°C, driven by wind and Coriolis force (0.00015 rad/s at 45°N).
- **Waves**: Wind generates 1–30 m swells (e.g., 2024 Pacific storm hit 25 m), with 0.1–1 Hz frequencies.
- **Tides**: Moon’s gravity (1.62 m/s²) lifts water 0.5–15 m twice daily; spring tides peak at 20 m in Bay of Fundy.
- **Temperature**: Surface averages 17°C, dropping to 2°C at 4,000 m; thermocline falls 1°C/100 m.

### Chemical Oceanography

Analyzes seawater composition:
- **Salinity**: 35 g/kg (3.5%), dominated by NaCl (85%), Mg²⁺, and SO₄²⁻; varies from 31 g/kg (Baltic) to 41 g/kg (Red Sea).
- **pH**: 8.1 historically, now 8.05 due to 0.1 unit acidification from 600 Gt CO₂ absorbed since 1750.
- **Dissolved Oxygen**: 8 mg/L at surface, 1 mg/L in oxygen minimum zones (500–1,000 m).

### Biological Oceanography

Explores marine life:
- **Phytoplankton**: 1 trillion tons fix 50 Gt C/year via photosynthesis, producing 50% of Earth’s O₂ (e.g., diatoms, 10 µm).
- **Zooplankton**: Copepods (10¹⁸ individuals) graze 10% of phytoplankton daily, cycling 1 Gt C.
- **Fish**: 3.5 trillion fish (e.g., anchovies, 10¹²) yield 90 Mt harvests/year.

### Geological Oceanography

Examines seafloor:
- **Continental Shelves**: 200 m deep, 7.5% of ocean area, rich in sediment (50 cm/ka deposition).
- **Mid-Ocean Ridges**: 65,000 km long, erupt 3 km³ basalt/year at 1,200°C.
- **Trenches**: Mariana Trench (10,984 m) subducts 8 cm/year, recycling crust over 180 Ma.

## Ocean Zones

- **Epipelagic (0–200 m)**: Sunlit, 90% of marine life, 20°C, 100 µmol photons/m²/s.
- **Mesopelagic (200–1,000 m)**: Twilight, 5°C, bioluminescent squid (10⁶ photons/s).
- **Bathypelagic (1,000–4,000 m)**: Dark, 2°C, 1 atm/10 m pressure (400 atm at base).
- **Abyssopelagic (4,000–6,000 m)**: 1°C, 10¹⁶ microbes/m³ in sediments.
- **Hadopelagic (>6,000 m)**: Trenches, 600 atm, amphipods thrive at 1 cal/g.

## History

- **Ancient**: Polynesians navigated 10,000 km via stars (100 arcmin accuracy); Aristotle noted saltwater’s density (1.025 g/cm³).
- **Age of Exploration**: Magellan’s 1519 circumnavigation mapped 60,000 km; Cook’s 1770s voyages charted Pacific currents (1 m/s).
- **19th Century**: Challenger Expedition (1872–1876) dredged 4,700 species, measured 8,000 m depths with lead lines (1% error).
- **20th Century**: SONAR (1915) mapped 10 m resolution; Trieste dove 10,916 m (1960).
- **21st Century**: Argo floats (4,000 units) track 1°C/10 m gradients; Ocean Cleanup nets 200 Mt plastic.

## Physical Properties

- **Volume**: 1.332 × 10⁹ km³, 97% of Earth’s water, 1,500 times atmospheric H₂O.
- **Density**: 1.025 g/cm³, rising to 1.070 g/cm³ at 4,000 m from compression.
- **Heat Capacity**: 4.18 J/g°C, storing 1,200 ZJ (10²¹ J), buffering climate (0.8°C rise since 1880).

## Ecosystems

- **Coral Reefs**: 284,300 km², 25% of marine species, grow 1 cm/year (e.g., Great Barrier Reef, 2,900 km).
- **Kelp Forests**: 50 m tall, 1,500 km², sequester 0.6 Gt C/year off California.
- **Deep Sea**: Hydrothermal vents (350°C, 2 µg/L O₂) host 10⁶ tubeworms/m².

## Human Interactions

- **Fisheries**: 200 Mt/year landed, $400 billion industry, 60% from aquaculture.
- **Shipping**: 90% of trade (12 billion tons), 100,000 vessels, emits 1 Gt CO₂/year.
- **Tourism**: $200 billion/year, 300 million visitors to coasts (e.g., Maldives, 1 m above sea level).

## Environmental Challenges

- **Warming**: 0.13°C/decade, melting 400 Gt ice/year, raising sea level 3.3 mm/year.
- **Acidification**: 26% more H⁺ since 1750, dissolving 0.5 Gt CaCO₃ shells/year.
- **Pollution**: 14 Mt plastic/year, 500 dead zones (10⁶ km²), 80% from land runoff.
