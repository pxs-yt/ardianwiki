# Elon Musk

Elon Reeve Musk (/ˈiːlɒn/ EE-lon; born June 28, 1971) is a businessman known for [his key roles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_career_of_Elon_Musk) in [Tesla, Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.), [SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX), and [Twitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter) (which he [rebranded as X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_under_Elon_Musk)). Since 2025, he has been a [senior advisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_Advisor_to_the_President) to United States president [Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump) and de facto head of the [Department of Government Efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Government_Efficiency) (DOGE). Musk is the [wealthiest person in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World%27s_Billionaires); as of February 2025, [Forbes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes) estimates [his net worth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_of_Elon_Musk) to be US$353 billion.

Born to [a prominent family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musk_family) in [Pretoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretoria), South Africa, Musk emigrated to Canada in 1989 and acquired its citizenship though his mother. He moved to the U.S. and graduated from the [University of Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania) before moving to [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California) to pursue business ventures. In 1995, Musk co-founded the software company [Zip2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip2). After its sale in 1999, he co-founded [X.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.com_(bank)), an online payment company that later merged to form [PayPal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal), which was acquired by [eBay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBay) in 2002 for $1.5 billion. That year, Musk also became a U.S. citizen.

In 2002, Musk founded [SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX) and became its CEO and chief engineer. The company has since led innovations in [reusable rockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_rocket) and [commercial spaceflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_spaceflight). In 2004, Musk joined [Tesla, Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.), as an early investor, and became its CEO and product architect in 2008; it has become a market leader in [electric vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle). In 2015, he co-founded [OpenAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI) to advance [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) research, but left its board in 2018. In 2016, Musk co-founded [Neuralink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuralink), a company focused on [brain–computer interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface), and in 2017 launched [the Boring Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boring_Company), which aims to develop tunnel transportation. Musk was named [Time magazine's Person of the Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Person_of_the_Year) in 2021. In 2022, he acquired Twitter, implementing significant changes and rebranding it as X in 2023. In January 2025, he was appointed head of Trump's newly created DOGE.

[Musk's political activities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_activities_of_Elon_Musk) and [views](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Views_of_Elon_Musk) have made him [a polarizing figure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_image_of_Elon_Musk). He has been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, including [COVID-19 misinformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Views_of_Elon_Musk#COVID-19_pandemic), [affirming antisemitic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Views_of_Elon_Musk#Race_and_white_nationalism) and [transphobic comments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Views_of_Elon_Musk#Transgender_issues), and [promoting conspiracy theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Views_of_Elon_Musk#Conspiracy_theories). His acquisition of Twitter (now X) was controversial due to a subsequent [increase in hate speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_under_Elon_Musk#Increase_in_hate_speech) and the [spread of misinformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_under_Elon_Musk#Handling_of_misinformation_and_disinformation) on the service. He has engaged in political activities in several countries, including as a vocal and financial supporter of Trump. Musk was the largest donor in the [2024 U.S. presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election) and is a supporter of global [far-right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right) figures, causes, and political parties.


## Early life

Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in [Pretoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretoria), South Africa's administrative capital.[2][3] He is of British and [Pennsylvania Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Dutch) ancestry.[4][5] His mother, [Maye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maye_Musk) ([née](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_name#Maiden_and_married_names) Haldeman), is a model and dietitian born in [Saskatchewan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatchewan), Canada, and raised in South Africa.[6][7][8][a] His father, [Errol Musk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errol_Musk), is a South African [electromechanical engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromechanics), pilot, sailor, consultant, [emerald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerald) dealer, and property developer, who partly owned a rental lodge at [Timbavati Private Nature Reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbavati_Private_Nature_Reserve).[14][15][16][17] Elon has a younger brother, [Kimbal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimbal_Musk), a younger sister, [Tosca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tosca_Musk), as well as four paternal half-siblings.[18][19][8][20] Musk was raised in the [Anglican Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglican_Church_of_Southern_Africa), in which he was [baptized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism).[21][22]

The Musk family was wealthy during Elon's youth.[17] Despite both Elon and Errol previously stating that Errol was a part owner of a Zambian emerald mine,[17] in 2023, Errol recounted that the deal he made was to receive "a portion of the emeralds produced at three small mines".[23][24] Errol was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid [Progressive Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Party_(South_Africa)) and has said that his children shared their father's dislike of [apartheid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid).[2]

After his parents divorced in 1980, Elon chose to live primarily with his father.[4][14] Elon later regretted his decision and became estranged from his father.[25] Elon has recounted trips to a wilderness school that he described as a "paramilitary [Lord of the Flies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_of_the_Flies)" where "bullying was a virtue" and children were encouraged to fight over rations.[26] In one incident, after an altercation with a fellow pupil, Elon was thrown down concrete steps and beaten severely, leading to him being hospitalized for his injuries.[27] Elon described his father berating him after he was discharged from the hospital.[27] Errol denied berating Elon and claimed, "The boy had just lost his father to suicide and Elon had called him stupid. Elon had a tendency to call people stupid. How could I possibly blame that child?"[28]

Elon was an enthusiastic reader of books, and had attributed his success in part to having read [The Lord of the Rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings), the [Foundation series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_(book_series)), and [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy_(novel)).[16][29] At age ten, he developed an interest in computing and video games, teaching himself how to program from the [VIC-20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIC-20) user manual.[30] At age twelve, Elon sold his [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC)-based game Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.[31][32]


### Education

Musk attended [Waterkloof House Preparatory School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterkloof_House_Preparatory_School), [Bryanston High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryanston_High_School), and then [Pretoria Boys High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretoria_Boys_High_School), where he graduated.[33] Musk was a good but unexceptional student, earning a 61 in [Afrikaans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaans) and a B on his senior math certification.[34] Musk applied for a Canadian passport [through](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jus_sanguinis) his Canadian-born mother to avoid South Africa's [mandatory military service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_South_Africa),[35][36] which would have forced him to participate in the apartheid regime,[2] as well as to ease his path to immigration to the United States.[37] While waiting for his application to be processed, he attended the [University of Pretoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pretoria) for five months.[38]

Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989, connected with a second cousin in Saskatchewan,[39] and worked odd jobs including at a farm and a lumber mill.[40] In 1990, he entered [Queen's University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_University_at_Kingston) in [Kingston, Ontario](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston,_Ontario).[41][42] Two years later, he transferred to the [University of Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania), where he studied until 1995.[43] Although Musk has said that he earned his degrees in 1995, the University of Pennsylvania did not award them until 1997 – a [Bachelor of Arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts) in physics and a [Bachelor of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Science) in economics from the university's [Wharton School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wharton_School).[44][45][46][47][48] He reportedly hosted large, ticketed house parties to help pay for tuition, and wrote a business plan for an electronic book-scanning service similar to [Google Books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Books).[49]

In 1994, Musk held two internships in [Silicon Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley): one at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which investigated electrolytic [supercapacitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercapacitor) for energy storage, and another at [Palo Alto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Alto,_California)–based startup [Rocket Science Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_Science_Games).[50][51] In 1995, he was accepted to a graduate program in [materials science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materials_science) at [Stanford University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University), but did not enroll.[46][44][52] Musk decided to join the [Internet boom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble), applying for a job at [Netscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape), to which he reportedly never received a response.[53][35] [The Washington Post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post) reported that Musk lacked legal authorization to remain and work in the United States after failing to enroll at Stanford.[52] In response, Musk said he was allowed to work at that time and that his student visa transitioned to an [H1-B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-1B_visa). According to numerous former business associates and shareholders, Musk said he was on a student visa at the time.[54]


## Business career


### Zip2

In 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded web software company [Zip2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip2) with funds borrowed from Musk's father.[55][25] They housed the venture at a small rented office in Palo Alto.[56] The company developed and marketed an Internet city guide for the newspaper publishing industry, with maps, directions, and yellow pages.[57]

According to Musk, "The website was up during the day and I was coding it at night, seven days a week, all the time."[56] The Musk brothers obtained contracts with [The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times) and the [Chicago Tribune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Tribune),[58] and persuaded the board of directors to abandon plans for a merger with [CitySearch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CitySearch).[59] Musk's attempts to become CEO were thwarted by the board.[60] [Compaq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compaq) acquired Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February 1999,[61][62] and Musk received $22 million for his 7-percent share.[63]


### X.com and PayPal

In 1999, Musk co-founded [X.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.com_(bank)), an online financial services and e-mail payment company.[64] The startup was one of the first [federally insured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Deposit_Insurance_Corporation) online banks, and, in its initial months of operation, over 200,000 customers joined the service.[65] The company's investors regarded Musk as inexperienced and replaced him with [Intuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuit) CEO Bill Harris by the end of the year.[66] The following year, X.com merged with online bank [Confinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confinity) to avoid competition.[56][66][67] Founded by [Max Levchin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Levchin) and [Peter Thiel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel),[68] Confinity had its own money-transfer service, [PayPal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal#History), which was more popular than X.com's service.[69]

Within the merged company, Musk returned as CEO. Musk's preference for [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft) software over [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) created a rift in the company and caused Thiel to resign.[70] Due to resulting technological issues and lack of a cohesive business model, the board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in 2000.[71][b] Under Thiel, the company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.[73][74] In 2002, PayPal was acquired by [eBay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBay) for $1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk—the largest shareholder with 11.72% of shares—received $175.8 million.[75][76] In 2017, Musk purchased the domain X.com from PayPal for an undisclosed amount, stating that it had sentimental value.[77][78]


### SpaceX

In 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit [Mars Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Society) and discussed funding plans to place a [growth-chamber for plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_farming) on [Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars).[79] Seeking a way to launch the greenhouse payloads into space, Musk made two unsuccessful trips to Moscow to purchase [intercontinental ballistic missiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercontinental_ballistic_missiles) (ICBMs) from Russian companies [NPO Lavochkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPO_Lavochkin) and [Kosmotras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmotras). Musk instead decided to start a company to build affordable rockets.[80] With $100 million of his early fortune,[81] Musk founded SpaceX in May 2002 and became the company's CEO and Chief Engineer.[82][83]

SpaceX attempted its first launch of the [Falcon 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_1) rocket in 2006.[84] Although the rocket failed to reach [Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_orbit), it was awarded a [Commercial Orbital Transportation Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Orbital_Transportation_Services) program contract from [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA), then led by [Mike Griffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_D._Griffin).[85][86] After two more failed attempts that nearly caused Musk to go bankrupt,[84] SpaceX succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 into orbit in 2008.[87] Later that year, SpaceX received a $1.6 billion NASA contract for [Falcon 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9)-launched [Dragon spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon) flights to the [International Space Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station) (ISS), replacing the [Space Shuttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle) after its 2011 [retirement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_retirement).[88] In 2012, the Dragon vehicle docked [with the ISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_COTS_Demo_Flight_2), a first for a commercial spacecraft.[89]

Working towards its goal of [reusable rockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_reusable_launch_system_development_program), in 2015 SpaceX successfully landed the [first stage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multistage_rocket) of a Falcon 9 on a land platform.[90] Later landings were achieved on [autonomous spaceport drone ships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_spaceport_drone_ship), an ocean-based recovery platform.[91] In 2018, SpaceX launched the [Falcon Heavy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_Heavy); the [inaugural mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_Heavy_test_flight) carried Musk's personal [Tesla Roadster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk%27s_Tesla_Roadster) as a [dummy payload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_(spaceflight)).[92][93] Since 2019,[94] SpaceX has been developing [Starship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship), a reusable, [super heavy-lift launch vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_heavy-lift_launch_vehicle) intended to replace the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy.[95] In 2020, SpaceX launched its first crewed flight, the [Demo-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crew_Dragon_Demo-2), becoming the first private company to place astronauts into orbit and dock a crewed spacecraft with the ISS.[96] In 2024, NASA awarded SpaceX an $843 million contract to [deorbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry) the ISS at the end of its lifespan.[97]


#### Starlink

In 2015, SpaceX began development of the [Starlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink) constellation of [low Earth orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit) satellites to provide [satellite Internet access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_Internet_access).[98] After the launch of prototype satellites in 2018, the first large constellation was deployed in May 2019.[99] The total cost of the decade-long project to design, build, and deploy the constellation was estimated by SpaceX in 2020 to be $10 billion.[100][c]

During the [Russian invasion of Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine), Musk provided free [Starlink service to Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starlink_in_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War), permitting Internet access and communication at a yearly cost to SpaceX of $400 million.[103][104][105][106][107] However, Musk refused to block [Russian state media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media_in_Russia) on Starlink.[108][109] In 2023, Musk denied Ukraine's request to activate Starlink over [Crimea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea) to aid an attack against the Russian navy, citing fears of a nuclear response.[110][111][112]


### Tesla

[Tesla, Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.), originally Tesla Motors, was incorporated in July 2003 by [Martin Eberhard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Eberhard) and [Marc Tarpenning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Tarpenning). Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement.[113] Musk led the [Series A round](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_A_round) of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.35 million, became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board of directors as chairman.[114][115] Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw [Roadster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Roadster_(first_generation)) product design, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[116] Following a series of escalating conflicts in 2007, and the [financial crisis of 2007–2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007%E2%80%932008_financial_crisis), Eberhard was ousted from the firm.[117][118] Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008.[119] A 2009 lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with Tarpenning and two others.[120][121]

Tesla began delivery of the Roadster, an electric sports car, in 2008. With sales of about 2,500 vehicles, it was the first [mass production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_production) all-electric car to use [lithium-ion battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-ion_battery) cells.[122] Under Musk, Tesla has since launched several well-selling electric vehicles, including the four-door sedan [Model S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_S) (2012), the [crossover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_(automobile)) [Model X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_X) (2015), the mass-market sedan [Model 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_3) (2017), the crossover [Model Y](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_Y) (2020), and the pickup truck [Cybertruck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Cybertruck) (2023).[123][124][125][126][127]

In May 2020 Musk resigned from chairman of the board as part of the settlement of a lawsuit from the SEC over him tweeting that funding had been "secured" for potentially taking Tesla private.[128][129]

The company has also constructed multiple lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle factories, called [Gigafactories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigafactory).[130] Since its [initial public offering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering) in 2010,[131] Tesla stock has risen significantly; it became the most valuable carmaker in summer 2020,[132][133] and it entered the [S&P 500](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500) later that year.[134][135] In October 2021, it reached a market capitalization of $1 trillion, the sixth company in U.S. history to do so.[136]


#### SolarCity and Tesla Energy

Musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for [SolarCity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SolarCity), which his cousins [Lyndon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_Rive) and Peter Rive founded in 2006.[137] By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest provider of solar power systems in the United States.[138] In 2014, Musk promoted the idea of SolarCity building an advanced production facility in [Buffalo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York), New York, triple the size of the largest solar plant in the United States.[139] Construction of the [factory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigafactory_New_York) started in 2014 and was completed in 2017. It operated as a joint venture with [Panasonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panasonic) until early 2020.[140][141]

Tesla acquired SolarCity for $2 billion in 2016 and merged it with its battery unit to create [Tesla Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Energy). The deal's announcement resulted in a more than 10% drop in Tesla's stock price; at the time, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues.[142] Multiple shareholder groups filed a lawsuit against Musk and Tesla's directors, stating that the purchase of SolarCity was done solely to benefit Musk and came at the expense of Tesla and its shareholders.[143][144] Tesla directors settled the lawsuit in January 2020, leaving Musk the sole remaining defendant.[145][146] Two years later, the court ruled in Musk's favor.[147]


### Neuralink

In 2016, Musk co-founded [Neuralink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuralink), a [neurotechnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotechnology) startup, with an investment of $100 million.[148][149] Neuralink aims to integrate the human brain with [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) (AI) by creating devices that are embedded in the brain. Such technology could enhance memory or allow the devices to communicate with software.[149][150] The company also hopes to develop devices to treat neurological conditions like [spinal cord injuries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_cord_injury).[151] In 2022, Neuralink announced that clinical trials would begin by the end of the year.[152] In September 2023, the [Food and Drug Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration) approved Neuralink to initiate six-year human trials.[153]

Neuralink has conducted [animal testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing) on [macaques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaque) at the [University of California, Davis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Davis). In 2021, the company released a video in which a macaque played the video game [Pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong) via a Neuralink implant. The company's animal trials—which have caused the deaths of some monkeys—have led to claims of [animal cruelty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruelty_to_animals). The [Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicians_Committee_for_Responsible_Medicine) has alleged that Neuralink violated the [Animal Welfare Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Welfare_Act_of_1966).[154] Employees have complained that pressure from Musk to accelerate development has led to botched experiments and unnecessary animal deaths. In 2022, a federal probe was launched into possible animal welfare violations by Neuralink.[155]


### The Boring Company

In 2017, Musk founded the Boring Company to construct tunnels, and revealed plans for specialized, underground, high-occupancy vehicles that could travel up to 150 miles per hour (240 km/h) and thus circumvent above-ground traffic in major cities.[156][157] Early in 2017, the company began discussions with regulatory bodies and initiated construction of a 30-foot (9.1 m) wide, 50-foot (15 m) long, and 15-foot (4.6 m) deep "test trench" on the premises of SpaceX's offices, as that required no permits.[158] The [Los Angeles tunnel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boring_test_tunnel), less than two miles (3.2 km) in length, debuted to journalists in 2018. It used Tesla Model Xs and was reported to be a rough ride while traveling at suboptimal speeds.[159] Two tunnel projects announced in 2018, in Chicago and West Los Angeles, have been canceled.[160][161] However, a tunnel beneath the [Las Vegas Convention Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Convention_Center) was completed in early 2021.[162] Local officials have approved further expansions of the tunnel system.[163]


### X Corp.

In early 2017, Musk expressed interest in buying [Twitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter,_Inc.) and had questioned the platform's commitment to [freedom of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech).[165][166][167] By 2022, Musk had reached 9.2% stake in the company,[168] making him the largest shareholder.[169][d] Musk later agreed to a deal that would appoint him to Twitter's board of directors and prohibit him from acquiring more than 14.9% of the company.[171][172] Days later, Musk made a $43 billion offer to buy Twitter.[169][173] By the end of April Musk had successfully concluded his bid for approximately $44 billion.[174] This included approximately $12.5 billion in loans and $21 billion in [equity financing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)).[175][176] Having back tracked on his initial decision,[177] Musk bought the company on October 27, 2022.[178]

Immediately [after the acquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk), Musk fired several top Twitter executives including CEO [Parag Agrawal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parag_Agrawal);[178][179] Musk became the CEO instead.[180] [Under Elon Musk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_under_Elon_Musk), Twitter instituted monthly subscription for a "[blue check](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_verification)",[181][182][183] and laid off a significant portion of the company's staff.[184][185] Musk lessened content moderation and hate speech also increased on the platform after his takeover.[186][187][188][189] In late 2022, Musk released [internal documents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Files) relating to Twitter's moderation of [Hunter Biden's laptop controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden_laptop_controversy) in the lead-up to the [2020 presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election).[190] Musk also promised to step down as CEO after a Twitter poll,[191][192] and five months later, Musk stepped down from [chief executive officer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer) (CEO) and transitioned his role to [executive chairman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_(officer)) and [chief technology officer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_technology_officer) (CTO).[193]

Despite Musk stepping down as [CEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer), X continues to struggle with challenges such as viral [misinformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation),[194] [hate speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech), and [antisemitism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism) controversies.[195][196] Musk has been accused of [trying to silence some of his critics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_under_Elon_Musk#Lawsuits)[197] by removing their accounts' [blue checkmarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_verification), which hinders visibility and is considered a form of [shadow banning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_banning),[198][199] or suspending their accounts without justification.[200]


## Other activities


### Hyperloop

In August 2013, Musk announced plans for a version of a [vactrain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vactrain), and assigned engineers from SpaceX and Tesla to design a transport system between [Greater Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Los_Angeles) and the [San Francisco Bay Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area), at an estimated cost of $6 billion.[201][202] Later that year, Musk unveiled the concept, dubbed the [Hyperloop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperloop),[203] intended to make travel cheaper than any other [mode of transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_of_transport) for such long distances.[204]


### OpenAI and xAI

In December 2015, Musk co-founded [OpenAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI), a [not-for-profit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_corporation) [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) (AI) research company aiming to develop [artificial general intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence), intended to be safe and beneficial to humanity.[205] Musk pledged $1 billion of funding to the company,[206] but only donated $50 million.[207] In 2018, Musk left the OpenAI board.[208] Since 2018, OpenAI has made significant advances in machine learning.[209] In July 2023, Musk launched the artificial intelligence company [xAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XAI_(company)), which aims to develop a [generative AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence) program that competes with existing offerings like OpenAI's [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT). Musk obtained funding from investors in SpaceX and Tesla,[210] and xAI hired engineers from Google and OpenAI.[211]


### Private jet

Musk uses a private jet owned by Falcon Landing LLC, a SpaceX-linked company, and acquired a second jet in August 2020.[213][214] His heavy use of the jets and the consequent [fossil fuel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel) usage have received criticism.[213][215] Musk's flight usage is tracked on social media through [ElonJet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ElonJet).[216][217][218] In December 2022, Musk banned the ElonJet account on Twitter, as well as temporary bans on the accounts of journalists that posted stories regarding the incident, including [Donie O'Sullivan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donie_O%27Sullivan_(journalist)), [Keith Olbermann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Olbermann), and journalists from [The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times), [The Washington Post](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post), CNN, and [The Intercept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Intercept).[219]


## Politics

Musk is an outlier among executives who typically avoid partisan political advocacy.[220][221][222] Musk was a registered [independent voter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_voter) when he lived in California.[223] Historically, he has donated to both [Democrats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)) and [Republicans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)),[224] many of whom serve in states in which he has a vested interest.[225] Beginning in 2022, his political contributions have mostly supported Republicans, with his first vote for a Republican going to Representative [Mayra Flores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayra_Flores) in the [2022 Texas's 34th congressional district special election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Texas%27s_34th_congressional_district_special_election).[226][227] In 2024, he started supporting international [far-right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right) political parties, activists, and causes,[228] and has shared far-right misinformation[229][230][231] and numerous [conspiracy theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theories).[232][233] As of 2024 [his views](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Views_of_Elon_Musk) were generally described as right-wing.[234]

Musk supported [Barack Obama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama) in [2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_US_presidential_election) and [2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_United_States_presidential_election),[235] [Hillary Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton) in [2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election), [Joe Biden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden) in [2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election),[236] and [Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump) in [2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election).[237] In the [2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries), Musk endorsed candidate [Andrew Yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Yang) and expressed support for Yang's proposed [universal basic income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income),[238] and endorsed [Kanye West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West)'s [2020 presidential campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West_2020_presidential_campaign).[239] In 2021, Musk publicly expressed opposition to the [Build Back Better Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Build_Back_Better_Act), a $3.5 trillion legislative package endorsed by Joe Biden that ultimately failed to pass due to unanimous opposition from congressional Republicans and several Democrats.[240] In 2022, Musk said he would start supporting [Republican Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)) candidates,[241] and gave over $50 million to [Citizens for Sanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_for_Sanity), a conservative [political action committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee).[242] In 2023, he supported Republican [Ron DeSantis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis) for the [2024 U.S. presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_US_presidential_election), giving $10 million to his campaign,[242] and hosted DeSantis's campaign announcement on a [Twitter Spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Spaces) event.[243][244][245] From June 2023 to January 2024, Musk hosted a bipartisan set of X Spaces with Republican and Democratic candidates, including [Robert F. Kennedy Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.),[246] [Vivek Ramaswamy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivek_Ramaswamy),[247] and [Dean Phillips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Phillips).[248]

By early 2024, Musk had become a vocal and financial supporter of Donald Trump.[249] In July 2024, after the [attempted assassination of Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Donald_Trump_in_Pennsylvania), Musk [endorsed him for president](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Donald_Trump_2024_presidential_campaign_endorsements).[250][251] During the [presidential campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2024_presidential_campaign), Musk joined Trump on stage at a campaign rally,[252] and during the campaign promoted conspiracy theories and falsehoods about Democrats, [election fraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_denial_movement_in_the_United_States)[253] and immigration, in support of Trump.[254][255] Musk was the largest individual donor of the 2024 election.[256]

Musk's international political actions and comments have come under increasing scrutiny and criticism, especially from the governments and leaders of France, Germany, Norway, Spain and the United Kingdom, due to his position in the [U.S. government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Trump_administration).[257][258][259]


### Trump's inauguration

In his speech during the [second inauguration of Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_inauguration_of_Donald_Trump), Musk thumped his right hand over his heart, fingers spread wide, and then extended his right arm out, emphatically, at an upward angle, palm down and fingers together. He then repeated the gesture to the crowd behind him. As he [finished the gestures,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk_salute_controversy) he said to the crowd, "My heart goes out to you. It is thanks to you that the future of civilization is assured."[260][261][262] The gesture was viewed as a [Nazi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_salute) or [Roman salute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_salute)[e] by some.[263][264][265] Musk derided the claims as politicized.[266][267] In a social media post, he wrote: "The 'everyone is Hitler' attack is sooo tired",[268] but did not explicitly deny the claims.[269] He has since denied it.[270] In further response to the events, Musk posted a series of puns about Nazis on Twitter.[271] Various media outlets, including the [Associated Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press), reported that regardless of what Musk meant, his gesture was widely embraced by right-wing extremists and [neo-Nazis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazis).[269][272]


### Department of Government Efficiency

The concept of DOGE emerged in a discussion between Musk and [Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump), and in August 2024, Trump committed to giving Musk an advisory role, with Musk accepting the offer.[273] In November and December 2024, Musk suggested that the organization could help to cut the [U.S. federal budget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_budget), consolidate the number of federal agencies,[274][275] and eliminate the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Financial_Protection_Bureau),[276][277] and that its final stage would be "deleting itself".[278]

In January 2025, the organization was created by [executive order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order), and Musk was designated a "[special government employee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_government_employee)".[279][280] Musk is leading the organization and is a [senior advisor to the president](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_Advisor_to_the_President_of_the_United_States), although his [official role](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_activities_of_Elon_Musk) is not clear.[281] In sworn statement during a lawsuit, the director of the White House [Office of Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Administration) stated that Musk "is not an employee of the U.S. DOGE Service or U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization", "is not the U.S. DOGE Service administrator", and has "no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself".[282][283] Trump said two days later that he had put Musk in charge of DOGE.[284]

In February 2025, Musk was criticized for his treatment of federal government employees,[285][286][287] including his influence over the [mass layoffs of the federal workforce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_United_States_federal_mass_layoffs), and his instruction to federal government employees to report their prior week's work, with non-responses being deemed a resignation or warranting termination.[288][289][290] He has prioritized secrecy within the organization[291] and has accused others of violating privacy laws.[279][279]


## Views

Rejecting the conservative label,[293] Musk has described himself as a [political moderate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_moderate), and his views have become more [right-wing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing) over time.[294] His views have been characterized as [libertarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism) and [far-right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics),[295][296] and after his [involvement in European politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_activities_of_Elon_Musk), they have received criticism from some world leaders.[297]

Within the context of [American politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Views_of_Elon_Musk#U.S._politics), Musk supported Democratic candidates up until 2022, at which point he voted for a Republican for the first time.[235][241][237] He has stated support for [universal basic income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income),[298] [gun rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_rights),[299] [freedom of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech),[300] a [tax on carbon emissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_on_carbon_emissions),[301] and [H-1B visas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-1B_visa).[302] Musk has expressed concern about issues such as [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) (AI)[303] and [climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change),[304] and has been a critic of [wealth tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_tax),[305] [short-selling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-selling),[306] [government subsidies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_subsidies),[307] and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia).[308] An immigrant himself, Musk has been accused of being [anti-immigration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-immigration), and regularly blames [immigration policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_policy_of_the_United_States) for [illegal immigration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration_to_the_United_States).[309] He is also a [pronatalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronatalist) who believes [population decline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_decline) is the biggest threat to civilization,[310] and believes in the principles of [Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity).[311][312]

Musk has [promoted conspiracy theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Views_of_Elon_Musk#Conspiracy_theories), and [made controversial statements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Views_of_Elon_Musk#Race_and_white_nationalism) that have led to accusations of [sexism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism), [antisemitism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism),[313][314] [transphobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transphobia),[315] disseminating [disinformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation), and support of [white pride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_pride).[316][317] While describing himself as a "pro-Semite",[318] his comments regarding [George Soros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Soros) and [Jewish communities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_communities) have been condemned by the [Anti-Defamation League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Defamation_League) and the [White House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House).[319] Isaacson's [biography of Musk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk_(Isaacson_book)) argued that some of his far-right views were "partially triggered" by the [transition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_transition) of his daughter, [Vivian Jenna Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivian_Jenna_Wilson).[320][321] Musk was criticized during the COVID-19 pandemic for making unfounded epidemiological claims,[322] defied [COVID-19 lockdowns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns) restrictions,[323] and supported the [Canada convoy protest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_convoy_protest) against [vaccine mandates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine_mandates).[324][325]


### International relations

Musk has been critical of Israel's [actions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_invasion_of_the_Gaza_Strip) in the [Gaza Strip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip) during the [Israel–Hamas war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel%E2%80%93Hamas_war),[326] praised China's economic and climate goals,[327][328] suggested that [Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan) and China should resolve [cross-strait relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-strait_relations),[329][330] and was described as having a close relationship with the [Chinese government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_government).[327][328]

In Europe, Musk expressed support for Ukraine in 2022 during the [Russian invasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine), recommended referendums and peace deals on the annexed [Russia-occupied territories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian-occupied_territories_of_Ukraine),[331][332] and supported the far-right [Alternative for Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_for_Germany) in Germany in 2024.[333] Regarding [British politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_politics), Musk blamed the [2024 UK riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_Kingdom_riots) on [mass migration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_migration) and [open borders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_border),[334][335] criticized Prime Minister [Starmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer) for what he described as a "two-tier" policing system,[336][337][338] and was subsequently attacked as being responsible for spreading [misinformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation) and amplifying the far-right.[339] He has also voiced his support for far-right activist [Tommy Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Robinson) and pledged electoral support for [Reform UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_UK).[340][341]


## Legal affairs

In 2018, Musk was [sued](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.#Lawsuits_and_controversies) by the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission) (SEC) for a [tweet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweet_(social_media)) stating that funding had been secured for potentially taking Tesla private.[342][f] The securities fraud lawsuit characterized the tweet as false, misleading, and damaging to investors, and sought to bar Musk from serving as CEO of [publicly traded companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company).[342][346][347] Two days later, Musk settled with the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. As a result, Musk and Tesla were fined $20 million each, and Musk was forced to step down for three years as Tesla chairman but was able to remain as CEO.[348] Shareholders filed a lawsuit over the tweet,[349] and in February 2023, a jury found Musk and Tesla not liable.[350] Musk has stated in interviews that he does not regret posting the tweet that triggered the SEC investigation.[351][352]

In 2019, Musk stated in a tweet that Tesla would build half a million cars that year.[353] The SEC reacted by asking a court to hold him [in contempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_court) for violating the terms of the 2018 settlement agreement. A joint agreement between Musk and the SEC eventually clarified the previous agreement details,[354] including a list of topics about which Musk needed preclearance.[355] In 2020, a judge blocked a lawsuit that claimed a tweet by Musk regarding Tesla stock price ("too high imo") violated the agreement.[356][357] [Freedom of Information Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act_(United_States)) (FOIA)-released records showed that the SEC concluded Musk had subsequently violated the agreement twice by tweeting regarding "[Tesla's solar roof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Energy) production volumes and its stock price".[358]

In October 2023, the SEC sued Musk over his refusal to testify a third time in an investigation into whether he violated federal law by purchasing Twitter stock in 2022.[359][360][361] In February 2024, Judge Laurel Beeler ruled that Musk must testify again.[362] In January 2025, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Musk for securities violations related to his purchase of Twitter.[363] In January 2024, Delaware Judge [Kathaleen McCormick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathaleen_McCormick) ruled in a 2018 lawsuit that Musk's $55 billion pay package from Tesla be rescinded.[364] McCormick called the compensation granted by the company's board "an unfathomable sum" that was unfair to shareholders.[365]


## Personal life

Musk became a U.S. citizen in 2002.[366] From the early 2000s until late 2020, Musk resided in California, where both Tesla and SpaceX were founded.[367] He then relocated to [Cameron County, Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_County,_Texas),[368][369] saying that California had become "complacent" about its economic success.[367][370][371]

While hosting [Saturday Night Live](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live) in 2021, Musk stated that he has [Asperger syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome) (now merged with [autism spectrum disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum_disorder)), although he has not been medically diagnosed.[372][373] Musk suffers from back pain and has undergone several spine-related surgeries, including a [disc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intervertebral_disc) replacement.[374][375] In 2000, he contracted a severe case of [malaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria) while on vacation in South Africa.[376] Musk has stated he uses doctor-prescribed [ketamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketamine) for occasional depression and that he doses "a small amount once every other week or something like that";[377] since January 2024, some media outlets have reported that he takes [ketamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketamine), [LSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSD), [ecstasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecstasy_(drug)), [mushrooms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucinogenic_mushrooms), [cocaine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine) and other drugs. Musk at first refused to comment his alleged drug use, then Musk responded, that he had not [tested](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_test) positive for drugs, and if drugs somehow improved his productivity, ‘I would definitely take them!’.[378]

Through his own label Emo G Records, Musk released a [rap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rap) track, "RIP [Harambe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harambe)", on [SoundCloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoundCloud) in March 2019.[379][380][381] The following year, he released an [EDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_dance_music) track, "Don't Doubt Ur Vibe", featuring his own lyrics and vocals.[382] Musk plays video games, which he stated has a "'restoring effect' that helps his 'mental calibration'",[383] including [Quake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(series)), [Diablo IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_IV), [Elden Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elden_Ring), and [Polytopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battle_of_Polytopia),[384][385] and has admitted to "account boosting", or cheating by hiring outside services to achieve top player rankings.[386][387]


### Relationships and children

Musk has fathered thirteen children, one of whom died as an infant.[388] He had six children with his first wife, Canadian author [Justine Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justine_Wilson), who he met while attending Queen's University in Ontario, Canada; they married in 2000.[389] In 2002, their first child Nevada Musk died of [sudden infant death syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_infant_death_syndrome) at the age of 10 weeks.[390] After his death, the couple used [in vitro fertilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation) (IVF) to continue their family;[391] they had twins in 2004, followed by triplets in 2006.[391] The couple divorced in 2008 and have [shared custody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_custody_(United_States)) of their children.[392][393] The elder twin he had with Wilson [came out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity) as a [trans woman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_woman) and, in 2022, officially [changed her name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_change) to Vivian Jenna Wilson,[394] adopting her mother's surname because she no longer wished to be associated with Musk.[394]

Musk began dating English actress [Talulah Riley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talulah_Riley) in 2008.[395] They married two years later at [Dornoch Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dornoch_Cathedral) in Scotland.[396][397] In 2012, the couple divorced, before remarrying the following year.[398] After briefly filing for divorce in 2014,[398] Musk finalized a second divorce from Riley in 2016.[399] Musk then dated [Amber Heard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber_Heard) for several months in 2017;[400] he had reportedly been "pursuing" her since 2012.[401]

In 2018, Musk and Canadian musician [Grimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimes) confirmed they were dating.[402] Grimes and Musk have three children, born in 2020, 2021, and 2023.[403][404][405] Musk and Grimes originally gave their eldest child the name "X [Æ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86) A-12", which would have violated California regulations as it contained characters that are not in the modern English alphabet;[406][407] the names registered on the birth certificate are "X" as a first name, "Æ A-[Xii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals)" as a middle name, and "Musk" as a last name.[408][409] They received criticism for choosing a name perceived to be impractical and difficult to pronounce;[410] Musk has said the intended pronunciation is "X Ash A Twelve".[409] Their second child was born via [surrogacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogacy).[411] Despite the pregnancy, Musk confirmed reports that the couple were "semi-separated" in September 2021; in an interview with [Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)) in December 2021, he said he was single.[412][413] In October 2023, Grimes sued Musk over parental rights and custody of X Æ A-Xii.[414][415][416]

Musk also has four children with [Shivon Zilis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shivon_Zilis), director of operations and special projects at [Neuralink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuralink): twins born via [IVF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation) in 2021, a child born in 2024 via surrogacy and a child born in 2025.[417][418][419][420][421]


## Wealth

Elon Musk is the [wealthiest person in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World%27s_Billionaires), with an estimated [net worth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_worth) of US$343 billion as of February 25, 2025, according to the [Bloomberg Billionaires Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_Billionaires_Index),[422] and $353 billion according to [Forbes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes),[423] primarily from his ownership stakes in [Tesla, Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.), and [SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX).[424]


### Musk Foundation

Musk is president of the Musk Foundation he founded in 2001,[430][431] whose stated purpose is to provide solar-power energy systems in disaster areas, with an interest in human space exploration, [pediatrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics), renewable energy, and "safe artificial intelligence".[432] From 2002 to 2018, the foundation donated nearly half of its $25 million directly to Musk's OpenAI.[433][434] The foundation's assets reached $9.4 billion by the end of 2021, but it only dispensed $160 million to charities that year.[435]

The Musk Foundation has been criticized for its "self-serving"[435] donations to efforts close to Musk's family and companies,[436] as well as its low payout ratio.[435][437] In 2021, after Musk challenged [World Food Programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Programme) director [David Beasley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Beasley) to draft a plan to use money of Musk's that Beasley said could contribute to ending [world hunger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunger),[438][439] Musk instead donated the $6 billion in question to his own foundation even after Beasley's plan showed that the money could feed 42 million people for a year.[440][435][441]


## Public image

Although his ventures have been highly influential within their separate industries starting in the 2000s, Musk only became a public figure in the early 2010s. He has been described as an eccentric who makes spontaneous and impactful decisions, while also often making controversial statements, contrary to other billionaires who prefer reclusiveness to protect their businesses. Musk's actions and [his expressed views](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Views_of_Elon_Musk) have made him a polarizing figure.[442] Biographer Ashlee Vance described people's opinions of Musk as polarized due to his "part philosopher, part [troll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_(slang))" persona on Twitter.[443] During a [2025 Conservative Political Action Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Political_Action_Conference#2025), Musk, while wearing a gold chain, sunglasses, and holding a chainsaw, stated: "I am become [meme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme)".[444]

Musk has been described as an American [oligarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligarchy) due to his extensive influence over public discourse, social media, industry, politics, and government policy.[445] His influence in the [second presidency of Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_presidency_of_Donald_Trump) led some to call him the "actual president-elect", "shadow president" or "co-president".[446][447]

[Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)) has listed Musk as [one of the most influential people in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_100) in 2010,[457] 2013,[458] 2018,[459] and 2021.[460] Musk was selected as Time's "[Person of the Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Person_of_the_Year)" for 2021. Then Time editor-in-chief [Edward Felsenthal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Felsenthal) wrote that, "Person of the Year is a marker of influence, and few individuals have had more influence than Musk on life on Earth, and potentially life off Earth too."[461][462]

Since you did not enroll, Stanford is not able to issue you an official certification document." Musk also had an explanation for the weird timing on his degrees from Penn. "I had a History and an English credit that I agreed with Penn that I would do at Stanford," he said. "The I put Stanford on deferment. Later, Penn's requirements changed so that you don't need the English and History credit. So they awarded me the degree in '97 when it was clear I was not going to go to grad school, and their requirement was no longer there."

LXXI, no. 1 (January 18, 2024), pp. 6, 8, 10. "There is an anti-modern impulse to Musk, a craving for lordship that can't be entirely satisfied within the confines of a capitalist economy. A king doesn't have advertisers or shareholders or customers, and Musk, if he continues on his current trajectory, may very well be abandoned by all three. [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle) says a good ending should be surprising but inevitable. It's possible to imagine multiple finales for Musk that meet these criteria, but the story always begins the same way. Once upon a time in [Pretoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretoria), there was a boy who wanted to be a man." (p. 10.)
