# Germany

Germany,[e] officially the Federal Republic of Germany,[f] is a country in [Central Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Europe). It lies between the [Baltic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Sea) and [North Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sea) to the north and the [Alps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps) to the south. Its sixteen [constituent states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Germany) have a total population of over 82 million in an area of 357,596 km2 (138,069 sq mi), making it the most populous [member state of the European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union). It borders [Denmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark) to the north, [Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland) and the [Czech Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic) to the east, [Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria) and [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland) to the south, and [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France), [Luxembourg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxembourg), [Belgium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium), and the [Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands) to the west. The [nation's capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_of_Germany) and [most populous city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_Germany_by_population) is [Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin) and its main [financial centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_centre) is [Frankfurt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt); the largest urban area is the [Ruhr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruhr).

Settlement in the territory of modern Germany began in the [Lower Paleolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Paleolithic), with various tribes inhabiting it from the [Neolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic) onward, chiefly the [Celts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celts). Various [Germanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_peoples) [tribes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_early_Germanic_peoples) have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since [classical antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity). A region named [Germania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germania) was documented before AD 100. In 962, the [Kingdom of Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Germany) formed the bulk of the [Holy Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire). During the 16th century, [northern German regions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Germany) became the centre of the [Protestant Reformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformation). Following the [Napoleonic Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars) and the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the [German Confederation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Confederation) was formed in 1815.

Formal [unification of Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_of_Germany) into the modern [nation-state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation_state) commenced on 18 August 1866 with the [North German Confederation Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_German_Confederation_Treaty) establishing the [Prussia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Prussia)-led [North German Confederation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_German_Confederation), which became the [German Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Empire) in 1871. After [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I) and the [German Revolution of 1918–1919](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Revolution_of_1918%E2%80%931919), the Empire was replaced by the [Weimar Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic). The [Nazi rise to power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler%27s_rise_to_power) in 1933 led to the establishment of [a totalitarian dictatorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany), [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II), and [the Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust). In 1949, [after the war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_World_War_II_in_Europe) and [a period of Allied occupation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied-occupied_Germany), Germany was organized into [two separate polities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_German_relations) with limited sovereignty: the Federal Republic of Germany, or [West Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germany), and the German Democratic Republic, or [East Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany). Berlin continued its [de jure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_jure) [Four Power status](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Power_Agreement_on_Berlin). The Federal Republic of Germany was a founding member of the [European Economic Community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Community) and the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union) in 1951, while the German Democratic Republic was a communist [Eastern Bloc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Bloc) state and member of the [Warsaw Pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Pact). After [the fall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaceful_Revolution) of the [communist led-government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Unity_Party_of_Germany) in East Germany, [German reunification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_reunification) saw the [former East German states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_states_of_Germany) join the Federal Republic of Germany on [3 October 1990](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Unity_Day).

Germany has been described as a [great power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_power) with [a strong economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Germany); it has the [largest economy in Europe by nominal GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_in_Europe_by_GDP_(nominal)). As a global power in industrial, [scientific and technological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_and_technology_in_Germany) sectors, it is both the world's [third-largest exporter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_exports) and [importer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_imports). As a [developed country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country), it [offers social security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_security_in_Germany), [a universal health care system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Germany), and [tuition-free university education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Germany#Tertiary_education). Germany is part of [multiple international organizations and forums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_relations_of_Germany#International_organizations). It has the [third-highest number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Sites_by_country) of UNESCO [World Heritage Sites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site): [54](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_Heritage_Sites_in_Germany), of which 51 are cultural.


## Etymology

The English word Germany derives from the Latin Germania, which came into use after [Julius Caesar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar) adopted it for the peoples east of the [Rhine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhine).[13] The [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language) term Deutschland, originally diutisciu land ('the German lands'), is derived from deutsch ([cf.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cf.) Dutch), descended from [Old High German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_High_German) diutisc 'of the people' (from diot or diota 'people'), originally used to distinguish the [language of the common people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernacular) from [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin) and its [Romance descendants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages). This in turn descends from [Proto-Germanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Germanic_language) *þiudiskaz 'of the people' (see also the Latinised form [Theodiscus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodiscus)), derived from *þeudō, descended from [Proto-Indo-European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language) *tewtéh₂- 'people', from which the word [Teutons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teutons) also originates.[14]


## History


### Prehistory

Pre-human ancestors, the [Danuvius guggenmosi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danuvius_guggenmosi), who were present in Germany over 11 million years ago, are theorized to be among the earliest ones to walk on two legs.[15] Ancient humans were present in Germany at least 600,000 years ago.[16] The first non-modern human fossil (the [Neanderthal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neanderthal)) was discovered in the [Neander Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neandertal_(valley)).[17] Similarly dated evidence of modern humans has been found in the [Swabian Jura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caves_and_Ice_Age_Art_in_the_Swabian_Jura), including 42,000-year-old [flutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_flute) which are the oldest musical instruments ever found,[18] the 40,000-year-old [Lion Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion-man),[19] and the 41,000-year-old [Venus of Hohle Fels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_of_Hohle_Fels).[20][21] The [Nebra sky disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebra_sky_disk), created during the [European Bronze Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Bronze_Age), has been attributed to a German site.[22]


### Germanic tribes, Roman frontier and the Frankish Empire

The [Germanic peoples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_peoples) are [thought to have emerged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnogenesis) from the [Jastorf culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jastorf_culture) during the [Nordic Bronze Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_Bronze_Age) or early [Iron Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Roman_Iron_Age).[23][24] From southern [Scandinavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia) and [northern Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Germany), they expanded south, east, and west, coming into contact with the [Celtic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celts), [Iranian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_peoples), [Baltic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balts), and [Slavic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Slavs) tribes.[25][26] Southern Germany was inhabited by Celtic-speaking peoples, who belonged to the wider [La Tène culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_T%C3%A8ne_culture). They were later assimilated by the Germanic conquerors.[27]

Under [Augustus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus), the [Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire) began to invade lands inhabited by the Germanic tribes, creating a short-lived Roman province of [Germania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germania_Antiqua) between the Rhine and [Elbe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbe) rivers. In 9 AD, three [Roman legions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_legion) were [defeated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Teutoburg_Forest) by [Arminius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arminius) in the [Battle of the Teutoburg Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Teutoburg_Forest).[28] The outcome of this battle dissuaded the Romans from their ambition of conquering [Germania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germania) and is thus considered one of the most important events in [European history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_history).[29] By 100 AD, when [Tacitus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacitus) wrote [Germania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germania_(book)), Germanic tribes had settled along the Rhine and the Danube (the [Limes Germanicus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limes_Germanicus)), occupying most of modern Germany. However, [Baden-Württemberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baden_W%C3%BCrttemberg), southern [Bavaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavaria), southern [Hesse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesse) and the western [Rhineland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhineland) had [been incorporated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_Wars) into [Roman provinces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_province).[30][31][32]

Around 260, Germanic peoples broke into Roman-controlled lands.[33] After the invasion of the [Huns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huns) in 375, and with the decline of Rome from 395, Germanic tribes moved farther southwest: the Franks established the [Frankish Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankish_Kingdom) and pushed east to subjugate [Saxony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Saxony) and [Bavaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Bavaria). Areas of what is today eastern Germany were inhabited by [Western Slavic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Slavs) tribes.[30]


### East Francia and the Holy Roman Empire

[Charlemagne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne) founded the [Carolingian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_Empire) in 800; it was [divided in 843](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Verdun).[34] The eastern successor kingdom of [East Francia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Francia) stretched from the Rhine in the west to the Elbe river in the east and from the North Sea to the Alps.[34] Subsequently, the Holy Roman Empire emerged from it. The [Ottonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottonian) rulers (919–1024) consolidated several major [duchies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_duchy).[35] In 996, [Gregory V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Gregory_V) became the first German Pope, appointed by his cousin [Otto III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_III), whom he shortly after crowned Holy Roman Emperor. The Holy Roman Empire absorbed northern Italy and [Burgundy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgundy_(historical_region)) under the [Salian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salian) emperors (1024–1125), although the emperors lost power through the [Investiture controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investiture_controversy).[36]

Under the [Hohenstaufen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Hohenstaufen) emperors (1138–1254), German princes encouraged German settlement to the south and east ([Ostsiedlung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostsiedlung)).[37] Members of the [Hanseatic League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanseatic_League), mostly north German towns, prospered in the expansion of trade.[38] The population declined starting with the [Great Famine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_of_1315%E2%80%931317) in 1315, followed by the [Black Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death) of 1348–1350.[39] The [Golden Bull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Bull_of_1356) issued in 1356 provided the constitutional structure of the Empire and codified the election of the emperor by seven [prince-electors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince-elector).[40]

[Johannes Gutenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Gutenberg) introduced moveable-type printing to Europe, laying the basis for the [democratization of knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratization_of_knowledge).[41] In 1517, [Martin Luther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther) incited the Protestant Reformation and [his translation of the Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luther_Bible) began the standardization of the language; the 1555 [Peace of Augsburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Augsburg) tolerated the "Evangelical" faith ([Lutheranism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutheranism)), but also decreed that the faith of the prince was to be the faith of his subjects ([cuius regio, eius religio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuius_regio,_eius_religio)).[42] From the [Cologne War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cologne_War) through the [Thirty Years' Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Years%27_War) (1618–1648), religious conflict devastated German lands and significantly reduced the population.[43][44]

The [Peace of Westphalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Westphalia) ended religious warfare among the [Imperial Estates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Estate).[43] The legal system initiated by a series of [Imperial Reforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Reform) (approximately 1495–1555) provided for considerable local autonomy and a stronger [Imperial Diet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Diet_(Holy_Roman_Empire)).[45] The [House of Habsburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Habsburg) held the imperial crown from 1438 until the death of [Charles VI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_VI,_Holy_Roman_Emperor) in 1740. Following the [War of the Austrian Succession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Austrian_Succession) and the [Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Aix-la-Chapelle_(1748)), Charles VI's daughter [Maria Theresa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Theresa) ruled as [empress consort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_consort) when her husband, [Francis I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor), became emperor.[46][47]

From 1740, [dualism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_dualism) between the Austrian [Habsburg monarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habsburg_monarchy) and the [Kingdom of Prussia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Prussia) dominated German history. In 1772, 1793, and 1795, Prussia and Austria, along with the [Russian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire), agreed to the [Partitions of Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partitions_of_Poland).[48][49] During the period of the [French Revolutionary Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolutionary_Wars), the [Napoleonic era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_era) and the subsequent [final meeting of the Imperial Diet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Recess_of_the_Reichsdeputation), most of the [Free Imperial Cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Imperial_Cities) were annexed by dynastic territories; the ecclesiastical territories were secularised and annexed. In 1806 the Imperium was dissolved; France, Russia, Prussia, and the Habsburgs (Austria) competed for hegemony in the German states during the [Napoleonic Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars).[50]


### German Confederation and Empire

Following the fall of [Napoleon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon), the [Congress of Vienna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Vienna) founded the German Confederation, a loose league of [39 sovereign states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_the_German_Confederation). The appointment of the [emperor of Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_of_Austria) as the permanent president reflected the Congress's rejection of [Prussia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussia)'s rising influence. Disagreement within [restoration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert_of_Europe) politics partly led to the rise of [liberal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism_in_Germany) movements, followed by new measures of repression by Austrian statesman [Klemens von Metternich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klemens_von_Metternich).[51][52] The [Zollverein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zollverein), a tariff union, furthered economic unity.[53] In light of [revolutionary movements in Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1848), intellectuals and commoners started the [revolutions of 1848 in the German states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_revolutions_of_1848%E2%80%931849), raising the German question. King [Frederick William IV of Prussia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_William_IV_of_Prussia) was offered the title of emperor, but with a loss of power; he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution, a temporary setback for the movement.[54]

King [William I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_I,_German_Emperor) appointed [Otto von Bismarck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_von_Bismarck) as the [Minister President of Prussia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_President_of_Prussia) in 1862. Bismarck successfully concluded the [war with Denmark in 1864](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Schleswig_War); the subsequent decisive Prussian victory in the [Austro-Prussian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austro-Prussian_War) of 1866 enabled him to create the [North German Confederation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_German_Confederation) which excluded [Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Empire). After the defeat of France in the [Franco-Prussian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Prussian_War), the German princes proclaimed the founding of the German Empire in 1871. Prussia was the dominant constituent state of the new empire; the King of Prussia ruled as its Kaiser, and Berlin became its capital.[55][56]

In the [Gründerzeit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%BCnderzeit) period following the unification of Germany, Bismarck's foreign policy as [chancellor of Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_Germany) secured Germany's position as a great nation by forging alliances and avoiding war.[56] However, under [Wilhelm II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_II), Germany took an [imperialistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Imperialism) course, leading to friction with neighbouring countries.[57] [A dual alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_Alliance_(1879)) was created with the [multinational realm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_state) of [Austria-Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria-Hungary); the [Triple Alliance of 1882](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Alliance_(1882)) included Italy. Britain, France and Russia also concluded alliances to protect against Habsburg interference with Russian interests in the Balkans or German interference against France.[58] At the [Berlin Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Conference) in 1884, Germany claimed several [colonies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_former_German_colonies) including [German East Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_East_Africa), [German South West Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_South_West_Africa), [Togoland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Togoland), and [Kamerun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamerun).[59] Later, Germany further expanded its colonial empire to include holdings in the Pacific and [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China).[60] The colonial government in South West Africa (present-day [Namibia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namibia)), from 1904 to 1908, carried out the [annihilation of the local Herero and Nama peoples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herero_and_Nama_genocide) as punishment for an uprising;[61][62][63] this was the 20th century's first [genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide).[62]

[The assassination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand_of_Austria) of [Austria's crown prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand_of_Austria) on 28 June 1914 provided the pretext for Austria-Hungary to attack Serbia and trigger [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I). After four years of warfare, in which approximately two million German soldiers were killed,[64] [a general armistice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armistice_with_Germany) ended the fighting. In the [German Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Revolution_of_1918%E2%80%931919) (November 1918), Wilhelm II and the ruling princes [abdicated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdication) their positions, and Germany was declared a [federal republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_republic). Germany's new leadership signed the [Treaty of Versailles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles) in 1919, accepting defeat by the [Allies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_I). Germans perceived the treaty as humiliating, which was seen by historians as influential in the rise of [Adolf Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler).[65] Germany lost around 13% of its European territory and ceded all of its colonial possessions in Africa and the Pacific.[66]


### Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany

On 11 August 1919, President [Friedrich Ebert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Ebert) signed the democratic [Weimar Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Constitution).[67] [Communists briefly seized power in Bavaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavarian_Soviet_Republic) and a few larger cities, while conservative elements failed to overthrow the central government in the 1920 [Kapp Putsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapp_Putsch). The [occupation of the Ruhr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_the_Ruhr) by Belgian and French troops and a period of [hyperinflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_the_Weimar_Republic) followed. A [plan to restructure Germany's war reparations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawes_Plan) and the creation of a [new currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Rentenmark) in 1924 helped stabilise the government and ushered in the [Golden Twenties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Twenties), an era of artistic innovation and liberal cultural life.[68][69][70]

The worldwide [Great Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression) hit Germany in 1929, and by 1932 the unemployment rate had risen to 24%.[71] The [Nazi Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Party) led by [Adolf Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler) became the largest party in the Reichstag after [the election of July 1932](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_1932_German_federal_election), and [President Hindenburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Hindenburg) appointed Hitler chancellor on 30 January 1933.[72] After the [Reichstag fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_fire), [a decree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_Fire_Decree) abrogated basic [civil rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights), and the first [Nazi concentration camp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_concentration_camps) opened.[73][74] On 23 March 1933, the [Enabling Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enabling_Act_of_1933) gave Hitler unrestricted legislative power, overriding the constitution,[75] and marked the beginning of Nazi Germany. His government established a centralised [totalitarian state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totalitarianism), [withdrew from the League of Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1933_German_referendum), and dramatically increased the country's [rearmament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_re-armament).[76] A government-sponsored programme for economic renewal focused on public works, the most famous of which was the [Autobahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichsautobahn).[77]

In 1935, the regime withdrew from the Treaty of Versailles and introduced the [Nuremberg Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Laws) which targeted [Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews) and other minorities.[78] Germany also reacquired control of the [Saarland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_of_the_Saar_Basin) in 1935,[79] [remilitarised the Rhineland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remilitarization_of_the_Rhineland) in 1936, [annexed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anschluss) Austria in 1938, [annexed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudetenland#Sudetenland_as_part_of_Nazi_Germany) the Sudetenland in 1938 with the [Munich Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Agreement), and in violation of the agreement [occupied Czechoslovakia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_occupation_of_Czechoslovakia) in March 1939.[80] [Kristallnacht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristallnacht) (Night of Broken Glass) saw the burning of synagogues, the destruction of Jewish businesses, and mass arrests of Jewish people.[81]

In August 1939, [Hitler's government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Nazi_Germany) negotiated the [Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop_Pact) that divided Eastern Europe into German and [Soviet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union) spheres of influence.[82] On 1 September 1939, Germany [invaded Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Poland), beginning [World War II in Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_theatre_of_World_War_II);[83] Britain and France declared war on Germany on 3 September.[84] In the spring of 1940, Germany [conquered Denmark and Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Weser%C3%BCbung), [the Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_invasion_of_the_Netherlands), [Belgium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_invasion_of_Belgium_(1940)), [Luxembourg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_invasion_of_Luxembourg), and [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_France), forcing the French government to sign an [armistice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armistice). The British repelled German air attacks in the [Battle of Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Britain) in the same year. In 1941, German troops [invaded Yugoslavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Yugoslavia), [Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Greece) and the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Barbarossa). By 1942, Germany and its allies controlled most of [continental Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German-occupied_Europe) and [North Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa), but following the Soviet victory at the [Battle of Stalingrad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Stalingrad), the Allied [reconquest of North Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_African_Campaign) and [invasion of Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Campaign_(World_War_II)) in 1943, German forces suffered repeated military defeats. In 1944, the Soviets [pushed into Eastern Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_II)#Summer_1944); the Western allies [landed in France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Overlord) and entered Germany despite a [final German counteroffensive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Bulge). Following [Hitler's suicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Adolf_Hitler) during the [Battle of Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Berlin), [Germany signed the surrender document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Instrument_of_Surrender) on 8 May 1945, [ending World War II in Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_World_War_II_in_Europe)[83][85] and Nazi Germany. Following the end of the war, surviving Nazi officials were tried for [war crimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crimes_of_the_Wehrmacht) at the [Nuremberg trials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_trials).[86][87]

In what later became known as [the Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust), the German government persecuted [minorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_victims), including interning them in concentration and [death camps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extermination_camp) across Europe. The regime systematically murdered 6 million Jews, at least 130,000 [Romani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porajmos), 275,000 [disabled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aktion_T4), thousands of [Jehovah's Witnesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses), thousands of [homosexuals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_homosexuals_in_Nazi_Germany), and hundreds of thousands of [political and religious opponents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nacht_und_Nebel).[88] [Nazi policies in German-occupied countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalplan_Ost) resulted in the deaths of an estimated 2.7 million [Poles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_people),[89] 1.3 million [Ukrainians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainians), 1 million [Belarusians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarusians) and 3.5 million [Soviet prisoners of war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_mistreatment_of_Soviet_prisoners_of_war).[90][86] [German military casualties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_casualties_in_World_War_II) have been estimated at 5.3 million,[91] and around 900,000 German civilians died.[92] Around 12 million [ethnic Germans were expelled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_and_expulsion_of_Germans_(1944%E2%80%931950)) from across Eastern Europe, and Germany lost roughly [one-quarter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Former_eastern_territories_of_Germany) of its pre-war territory.[93]


### East and West Germany

After the surrender of Nazi Germany, the [Allies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II) de jure [abolished](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Declaration_(1945)) the German state and partitioned Berlin and Germany's remaining territory into four occupation zones. The western sectors, controlled by France, the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom), and the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States), were merged on 23 May 1949 to form the [Federal Republic of Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germany) ([German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language): Bundesrepublik Deutschland); on 7 October 1949, the Soviet Zone became the [German Democratic Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany) (GDR) (Deutsche Demokratische Republik; DDR). They were informally known as West Germany and East Germany.[94] East Germany selected [East Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Berlin) as its capital, while West Germany chose [Bonn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonn) as a provisional capital, to emphasise its stance that the two-state solution was temporary.[95]

West Germany was established as a federal parliamentary republic with a [social market economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_market_economy). In 1948, West Germany became a major recipient of reconstruction aid under the American [Marshall Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Plan).[96] [Konrad Adenauer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konrad_Adenauer) was elected the first [federal chancellor of Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Chancellor_of_the_Federal_Republic_of_Germany) in 1949. The country enjoyed prolonged economic growth ([Wirtschaftswunder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirtschaftswunder)) beginning in the early 1950s.[97] West Germany joined [NATO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO) in 1955 and was a founding member of the [European Economic Community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Community).[98] On 1 January 1957, the [Saarland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saar_Protectorate) joined West Germany.[99]

East Germany was an [Eastern Bloc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Bloc) state under political and military control by the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union) via occupation forces and the [Warsaw Pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Pact). Although East Germany claimed to be a democracy, political power was exercised solely by leading members ([Politbüro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politburo)) of the communist-controlled [Socialist Unity Party of Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Unity_Party_of_Germany), supported by the [Stasi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stasi), an immense secret service.[100] While [East German propaganda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_propaganda) was based on the benefits of the GDR's social programmes and the alleged threat of a West German invasion, many of its citizens looked to the West for freedom and prosperity.[101] The [Berlin Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Wall), built in 1961, prevented East German citizens from escaping to West Germany, becoming a symbol of the [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War).[102]

Tensions between East and West Germany were reduced in the late 1960s by Chancellor [Willy Brandt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willy_Brandt)'s [Ostpolitik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostpolitik).[103] In 1989, Hungary decided to dismantle the [Iron Curtain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Curtain) and [open its border with Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Removal_of_Hungary%27s_border_fence_with_Austria), causing the emigration of thousands of East Germans to West Germany via Hungary and Austria. This had devastating effects on the GDR, where regular [mass demonstrations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monday_demonstrations_in_East_Germany) received increasing support. In an effort to help retain East Germany as a state, the East German authorities eased border restrictions, but this actually led to an acceleration of the Wende reform process culminating in the [Two Plus Four Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Final_Settlement_with_Respect_to_Germany) under which Germany regained full sovereignty. This permitted [German reunification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_reunification) on 3 October 1990, with the accession of the [five re-established states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_states_of_Germany) of the former GDR.[104] The fall of the Wall in 1989 became a symbol of the [Fall of Communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Communism), the [dissolution of the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union), German reunification and [Die Wende](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Wende) ("the turning point").[105]


### Reunified Germany and the European Union

United Germany was considered the enlarged continuation of [West Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Germany) so it retained its memberships in international organisations.[106] Based on the [Berlin/Bonn Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin/Bonn_Act) (1994), [Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin) again became the capital of Germany, while [Bonn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonn) obtained the unique status of a Bundesstadt (federal city) retaining some federal ministries.[107] The relocation of the government was completed in 1999, and modernisation of the East German economy was scheduled to last until 2019.[108][109]

Since reunification, Germany has taken a more active role in the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union), signing the [Maastricht Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maastricht_Treaty) in 1992 and the [Lisbon Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisbon_Treaty) in 2007,[110] and co-founding the [eurozone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone).[111] Germany sent a peacekeeping force to secure stability in the [Balkans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_NATO_bombing_in_Yugoslavia) and sent [German troops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundeswehr) to [Afghanistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan) as part of a NATO effort to provide [security in that country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001%E2%80%932021)) after the ousting of the [Taliban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban).[112][113]

In the [2005 elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_German_federal_election), [Angela Merkel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Merkel) became the first female chancellor. In 2009, the German government approved a €50 billion stimulus plan.[114] Among the major German political projects of the early 21st century are the advancement of [European integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_integration), the [energy transition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_transition_in_Germany) (Energiewende) for a [sustainable energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy) supply, the [debt brake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_brake_(Germany)) for balanced budgets, measures to increase the [fertility rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing_of_Europe#Germany) ([pronatalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalistic_politics)), and [high-tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-tech) strategies for the transition of the German economy, summarised as [Industry 4.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_4.0).[115] During the [2015 European migrant crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_European_migrant_crisis), the country took in over a million refugees and migrants.[116]


## Geography

Germany is the [seventh-largest country in Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_countries_by_area).[4] It borders [Denmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark) to the north, [Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland) and [Czechia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic) to the east, [Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria) and [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland) to the south, and [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France), [Luxembourg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxembourg), [Belgium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium), and the [Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands) to the west. Germany is also bordered by the North Sea and, at the north-northeast, by the Baltic Sea. German territory covers 357,596 km2 (138,069 sq mi).[6] Elevation ranges from the mountains of the Alps (highest point: the [Zugspitze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zugspitze) at 2,963 metres or 9,721 feet) in the south to the shores of the North Sea (Nordsee) in the northwest and the [Baltic Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Sea) (Ostsee) in the northeast. The forested uplands of central Germany and the lowlands of northern Germany (lowest point: in the municipality [Neuendorf-Sachsenbande](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuendorf-Sachsenbande), [Wilstermarsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilstermarsch) at 3.54 metres or 11.6 feet below sea level[117]) are traversed by such major rivers as the Rhine, [Danube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danube) and Elbe. Significant natural resources include iron ore, coal, [potash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potash), timber, [lignite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lignite), [uranium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium), copper, natural gas, salt, and nickel.[4]


### Climate

Most of Germany has a [temperate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate) climate, ranging from [oceanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_climate) in the north and west to [continental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_climate) in the east and southeast. Winters range from the cold in the Southern Alps to cool and are generally overcast with limited precipitation, while summers can vary from hot and dry to cool and rainy. The northern regions have prevailing westerly winds that bring in moist air from the North Sea, moderating the temperature and increasing precipitation. Conversely, the southeast regions have more extreme temperatures.[118]

From February 2019–2020, average monthly temperatures in Germany ranged from a low of 3.3 °C (37.9 °F) in January 2020 to a high of 19.8 °C (67.6 °F) in June 2019.[119] Average monthly precipitation ranged from 30 litres per square metre in February and April 2019 to 125 litres per square metre in February 2020.[120] Average monthly hours of sunshine ranged from 45 in November 2019 to 300 in June 2019.[121]

[Climate change in Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_Germany) is leading to long-term impacts on agriculture, more intense [heatwaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heatwave) and [coldwaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coldwave), flash and [coastal flooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_flooding), and reduced water availability.[122] [Climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change) could cost Germany up to €900 billion by 2050.[123]


### Biodiversity

The territory of Germany can be divided into five terrestrial [ecoregions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecoregion): [Atlantic mixed forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_mixed_forests), [Baltic mixed forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_mixed_forests), [Central European mixed forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_European_mixed_forests), [Western European broadleaf forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_European_broadleaf_forests), and [Alps conifer and mixed forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps_conifer_and_mixed_forests).[124] As of 2016, 51% of Germany's land area is devoted to agriculture, while 30% is forested and 14% is covered by settlements or infrastructure.[125]

Plants and animals include those generally common to Central Europe. According to the National Forest Inventory, [beeches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beeches), [oaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak), and other [deciduous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous) trees constitute just over 40% of the forests; roughly 60% are [conifers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conifers), particularly [spruce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spruce) and [pine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine).[126] There are many species of [ferns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fern), [flowers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowers), [fungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungi), and [mosses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosses). Wild animals include [roe deer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_European_red_deer), [wild boar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_European_boar), [mouflon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouflon) (a subspecies of wild sheep), [fox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_fox), [badger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_badger), [hare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_hare), and small numbers of the [Eurasian beaver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_beaver).[127] The blue [cornflower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornflower) was once a German [national symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floral_emblem).[128]

The [16 national parks in Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_parks_of_Germany) include the [Jasmund National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmund_National_Park), the [Vorpommern Lagoon Area National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorpommern_Lagoon_Area_National_Park), the [Müritz National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCritz_National_Park), the [Wadden Sea National Parks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wadden_Sea_National_Parks), the [Harz National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harz_National_Park), the [Hainich National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hainich_National_Park), the [Black Forest National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Forest_National_Park), the [Saxon Switzerland National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxon_Switzerland_National_Park), the [Bavarian Forest National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavarian_Forest_National_Park) and the [Berchtesgaden National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berchtesgaden_National_Park).[129] In addition, there are [17 Biosphere Reserves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosphere_Reserves_in_Germany),[130] and [105 nature parks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_parks_(Germany)).[131] More than [400 zoos and animal parks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_zoos_in_Germany) operate in Germany.[132] The [Berlin Zoo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Zoological_Garden), which opened in 1844, is the oldest in Germany, and claims the most comprehensive collection of species in the world.[133]


## Politics

Germany is a [federal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_republic), [parliamentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_democratic), [representative democratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy) republic. Federal [legislative power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative_power) is vested in the parliament consisting of the [Bundestag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundestag) (Federal Diet) and [Bundesrat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesrat_of_Germany) (Federal Council), which together form the legislative body. The Bundestag is elected through [direct elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_election) using the [mixed-member proportional representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-member_proportional_representation) system. The members of the Bundesrat represent and are appointed by the governments of the sixteen federated states.[4] The German political system operates under a framework laid out in the 1949 constitution known as the [Grundgesetz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Law_for_the_Federal_Republic_of_Germany) (Basic Law). Amendments generally require a two-thirds majority of both the Bundestag and the Bundesrat; the fundamental principles of the constitution, as expressed in the articles guaranteeing human dignity, the separation of powers, the federal structure, and the [rule of law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law), are valid in perpetuity.[134]

[The president](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Germany), who has been [Frank-Walter Steinmeier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank-Walter_Steinmeier) since 2017, is the [head of state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state) and invested primarily with representative responsibilities and powers. He is elected by the [Bundesversammlung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesversammlung_(Germany)) (federal convention), an institution consisting of the members of the Bundestag and an equal number of state delegates.[4] The second-highest official in the [German order of precedence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_order_of_precedence) is the Bundestagspräsident ([President of the Bundestag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Bundestag)), who is elected by the Bundestag and responsible for overseeing the daily sessions of the body.[135] The third-highest official and the [head of government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_government) is the chancellor, who is appointed by the Bundespräsident after being elected by the party or coalition with the most seats in the Bundestag.[4] [The chancellor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_Germany), who has been [Olaf Scholz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olaf_Scholz) since 2021, is the head of government and exercises [executive power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)) through [his Cabinet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Germany).[4]

Since 1949, the party system has been dominated by the [Christian Democratic Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Democratic_Union_(Germany)) and the [Social Democratic Party of Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany). So far every chancellor has been a member of one of these parties. However, the smaller liberal [Free Democratic Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Democratic_Party_(Germany)) and the [Alliance 90/The Greens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_90/The_Greens) have also been junior partners in [coalition governments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government). Since 2007, the democratic socialist party [The Left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Left_(Germany)) has been a staple in the German Bundestag, though they have never been part of the federal government. In the [2017 German federal election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_German_federal_election), the right-wing populist [Alternative for Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_for_Germany) gained enough votes to attain representation in the parliament for the first time.[136][137]


### Constituent states

Germany is a [federation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation) and comprises sixteen [constituent states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Germany) which are collectively referred to as Länder.[138] Each state (Land) has its own constitution,[139] and is largely autonomous in regard to its internal organisation.[138] As of 2017, Germany is divided into 401 [districts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Germany) (Kreise) at a municipal level; these consist of 294 [rural districts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rural_districts_of_Germany) and 107 [urban districts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_districts_of_Germany).[140]

### Law

Germany has a [civil law system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_law_(legal_system)) based on [Roman law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_law) with some references to [Germanic law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_law).[144] The [Bundesverfassungsgericht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Constitutional_Court_of_Germany) (Federal Constitutional Court) is the German Supreme Court responsible for constitutional matters, with power of [judicial review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_review).[145] Germany's specialized supreme court system includes the [inquisitorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquisitorial_system) [Federal Court of Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Court_of_Justice) for civil and criminal cases, along with the [Federal Labour Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Labour_Court), [Federal Social Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Social_Court), [Federal Fiscal Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Fiscal_Court), and [Federal Administrative Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Administrative_Court_(Germany)) for other matters.[146]

Criminal and private laws are codified on the national level in the [Strafgesetzbuch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strafgesetzbuch) and the [Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%BCrgerliches_Gesetzbuch) respectively. The German penal system seeks the [rehabilitation of the criminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehabilitation_(penology)) and the protection of the public.[147] With the exceptions of petty crimes, tried by a single professional judge, and of serious political crimes, all charges are adjudicated by mixed tribunals where [lay judges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lay_judge) ([Schöffen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sch%C3%B6ffe)) and professional judges preside together.[148][149]

In 2016, Germany's murder rate stood at a low of 1.18 murders per 100,000.[150] In 2018, the overall [crime rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_Germany) fell to its lowest since 1992.[151]

Germany has a network of 227 diplomatic missions abroad[153] and maintains relations with more than 190 countries.[154] Germany is a member of the [Council of Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Europe), [NATO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO), the [OECD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_for_Economic_Co-operation_and_Development), the [G7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G7), the [G20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G20), the [World Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank) and the [IMF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund). It has played an influential role in the European Union since its inception and has maintained a [strong alliance with France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-German_cooperation) and all neighbouring countries since 1990. Germany promotes the creation of a more unified European political, economic and security apparatus.[155][156][157] The governments of Germany and the United States [are close political allies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany%E2%80%93United_States_relations).[158] Cultural ties and economic interests have crafted a bond between the two countries resulting in [Atlanticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanticism).

[159] After 1990, [Germany and Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany%E2%80%93Russia_relations) worked together to establish a "strategic partnership" in which [energy development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_development) became one of the most important factors. As a result of the cooperation, Germany imported most of its natural gas and crude oil from Russia.[160][161]

Germany's development policy functions as a distinct sector within its foreign policy framework. It is formulated by the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development and carried out by the implementing organisations. The German government sees development policy as a joint responsibility of the international community.[162] It was the world's [second-biggest aid donor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_development_aid_sovereign_state_donors) in 2019 after the United States.[163]


### Military

Germany's military, the Bundeswehr (Federal Defence), is organised into the [Heer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Army) (Army and special forces [KSK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kommando_Spezialkr%C3%A4fte)), [Marine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Navy) (Navy), [Luftwaffe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Air_Force) (Air Force) and [Cyber- und Informationsraum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_and_Information_Domain_Service) (Cyber and Information Domain Service) branches.[164] In absolute terms, German military spending in 2023 was the [seventh-highest in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures).[165] In response to the 2022 [Russian invasion of Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War), Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced that German military expenditure would be increased past the NATO target of 2%, along with a one-time 2022 infusion of 100 billion euros, representing almost double the 53 billion euro military budget for 2021.[166][167] In 2023, military spending according to NATO criteria amounted to $73.1 billion, or 1.64% of the country's GDP, well below the NATO target of 2%. In 2024, Germany reported $97.7 billion to NATO, exceeding the NATO target of 2% at 2.12% of GDP.[168]

As of May 2024, the Bundeswehr has a strength of 180,215 active soldiers and 80,761 civilians.[169] Reservists are available to the armed forces and participate in defence exercises and deployments abroad.[170] Until 2011, [military service was compulsory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_Germany) for men at age 18, but this has been officially suspended and replaced with a voluntary service.[171][172] Since 2001 women may serve in all functions of service without restriction.[173] According to the [Stockholm International Peace Research Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_International_Peace_Research_Institute), Germany was the [fifth-largest exporter of major arms in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_arms_exports) from 2019 to 2023.[174]

In peacetime, the Bundeswehr is commanded by the Minister of Defence. In [state of defence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Defence_(Germany)), the Chancellor would become commander-in-chief of the Bundeswehr.[175] The role of the Bundeswehr is described in the [Constitution of Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Germany) as defensive only. But after a ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court in 1994, the term "defence" has been defined not only to include protection of the borders of Germany, but also crisis reaction and conflict prevention, or more broadly as guarding the [security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security) of Germany anywhere in the world. As of 2017, the German military has about 3,600 troops stationed in foreign countries as part of international peacekeeping forces, including about 1,200 supporting operations against [Daesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daesh), 980 in the NATO-led [Resolute Support Mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolute_Support_Mission) in Afghanistan, and 800 in [Kosovo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo).[176][177]

## Demographics

With a population of 84.7 million according to the 2023 German census,[229] Germany is the most populous country in the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union), the [second-most populous country in Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_countries_by_population) after [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia),[4][g] and the [nineteenth-most populous country in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population). Its [population density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_population_density) stands at 236 inhabitants per square kilometre (610 inhabitants/sq mi). The [fertility rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_fertility_rate) of 1.57 children born per woman (2022 estimates) is below the replacement rate of 2.1 and is one of the [lowest fertility rates in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_fertility_rate).[4] Since the 1970s, Germany's [death rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_rate) has exceeded its [birth rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_rate). However, Germany is witnessing increased birth rates and migration rates since the beginning of the 2010s. Germany has the [third oldest population in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_median_age), with an average age of 47.4 years.[4]

Four sizeable groups of people are referred to as national minorities because their ancestors have lived in their respective regions for centuries:[231] There is a [Danish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danes) minority in the northernmost state of [Schleswig-Holstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schleswig-Holstein);[231] the [Sorbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorbs), a [Slavic population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavic_people), are in the [Lusatia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lusatia) region of [Saxony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_State_of_Saxony) and [Brandenburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg); the [Roma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people) and [Sinti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinti) live throughout the country; and the [Frisians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisians) are concentrated in Schleswig-Holstein's western coast and in the north-western part of [Lower Saxony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Saxony).[231]

Germany is [a major destination for immigrants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_Germany), ranking second in the world after the United States in terms of immigration.[232] In 2015, following the [2015 refugee crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_European_migrant_crisis), the Population Division of the [United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Department_of_Economic_and_Social_Affairs) listed Germany as host to the [second-highest number of international migrants worldwide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_immigrant_population), about 5% or 12 million of all 244 million migrants.[233] Refugee crises have resulted in substantial population increases;[234] for example, the major influx of Ukrainian immigrants following the [2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine), whereby over 1.06 million refugees from Ukraine were recorded in Germany as of April 2023.[235] As of 2019, Germany ranks seventh among EU countries in terms of the percentage of migrants in the country's population, at 13.1%.[236] In 2022, there were 23.8 million people—28.7 percent of the total population—who had a migration background.[237]

Germany has a number of large [cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_and_towns_in_Germany). There are 11 officially recognised [metropolitan regions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_regions_in_Germany). The [country's largest city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_Germany_by_population) is [Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin), while its largest urban area is the [Ruhr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruhr).[238]

### Religion

According to the 2022 census, [Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_in_Germany) is the largest religion at 49.7% of the population; 23.1% identified as Protestant and 25.1% as Catholic.[240]

[Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Germany) is the second-largest religion in the country.[241] In the 2011 census, 1.9% of respondents (1.52 million people) gave their religion as Islam, but this figure is deemed unreliable because a disproportionate number of adherents of this faith (and other religions, such as Judaism) are likely to have made use of their right not to answer the question.[242] In 2019, there were an estimated 5.3–5.6 million Muslims with a migrant background[h] (6.4–6.7% of the population), in addition to an unknown number of Muslims without a migrant background.[243] Most of the Muslims are [Sunnis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni_Islam) and [Alevis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alevism) from Turkey, but there are a small number of [Shi'ites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam), [Ahmadiyyas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmadiyya) and other denominations. Other religions each comprise less than one percent of Germany's population.[241]

In 2011, formal members of the [Jewish community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Germany) represented no more than 0.2% of the total German population, and 60% of them resided in [Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin).[244] An estimated 80 to 90 percent of these Jews in Germany are Russian-speaking immigrants from the [former Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Soviet_states), who came to Germany from the 1980s onwards.[245][246]

A study in 2023 estimated that 46.2% of the population are not members of any religious organization or [denomination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_denomination).[247] [Irreligion in Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreligion_in_Germany) is strongest in the former [East Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany), which used to be predominantly Protestant before the enforcement of [state atheism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_atheism), and in major metropolitan areas.[248][249]


### Languages

German is the official and predominantly spoken language in Germany.[250] It is one of 24 official and working [languages of the European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_the_European_Union), and one of the three [procedural languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_the_European_Union) of the [European Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission), alongside English and French.[251] German is the most widely spoken first language in the European Union, with around 100 million native speakers.[252]

Recognised native minority languages in Germany are [Danish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_language), [Low German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_German), [Low Rhenish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Rhenish), [Sorbian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorbian_languages), [Romani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_language), [North Frisian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Frisian_language) and [Saterland Frisian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saterland_Frisian_language); they are officially protected by the [European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Charter_for_Regional_or_Minority_Languages). The most used immigrant languages are [Turkish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_language), [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic), [Kurdish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdish_language), [Polish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_language), [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language), [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language), [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language), [Serbo-Croatian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbo-Croatian), [Bulgarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_language) and other [Balkan languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan_languages), as well as [Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language). Germans are typically multilingual: 67% of German citizens claim to be able to communicate in at least one foreign language and 27% in at least two.[250]


### Education

Responsibility for educational supervision in Germany is primarily organised within the individual [states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Germany). Optional [kindergarten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindergarten) education is provided for all children between three and six years old, after which [school attendance is compulsory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schulpflicht) for at least nine years depending on the state. Primary education usually lasts for four to six years.[253] Secondary schooling is divided into tracks based on whether students pursue [academic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College-preparatory_school) or [vocational education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocational_education).[254] A system of apprenticeship called [Duale Ausbildung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_education_system) leads to a skilled qualification which is almost comparable to an academic degree. It allows students in vocational training to learn in a company as well as in a state-run trade school.[253] This model is well regarded and reproduced all around the world.[255]

Most of the [German universities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_universities_in_Germany) are public institutions, and students traditionally study without fee payment.[256] The general requirement for attending university is the [Abitur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abitur). According to an OECD report in 2014, Germany is the world's third leading destination for international study.[257] The established universities in Germany include some of the [oldest in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_universities_in_continuous_operation), with [Heidelberg University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidelberg_University) (established in 1386), [Leipzig University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig_University) (established in 1409) and the [University of Rostock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Rostock) (established in 1419) being the oldest in the country.[258] The [Humboldt University of Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humboldt_University_of_Berlin), founded in 1810 by the liberal educational reformer [Wilhelm von Humboldt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_von_Humboldt), became the academic [model for many Western universities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humboldtian_model_of_higher_education).[259][260] In the contemporary era, Germany has developed eleven [Universities of Excellence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Universities_Excellence_Initiative).


### Health

Germany's system of hospitals, called Krankenhäuser, dates from medieval times, and today, Germany has the world's oldest [universal health care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_health_care) system, dating from [Bismarck's social legislation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_von_Bismarck#Social_legislation) of the 1880s.[262] Since the 1880s, reforms and provisions have ensured a balanced health care system. The population is covered by a health insurance plan provided by statute, with criteria allowing some groups to opt for a private health insurance contract. According to the [World Health Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization) (WHO), Germany's [health care system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_system) was 77% government-funded and 23% privately funded in 2013.[263] In 2014, Germany spent 11.3% of its GDP on health care.[264]

Germany ranked 21st in the world in 2019 in life expectancy with [78.7 years for men and 84.8 years for women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy) according to the WHO, and it had a very low [infant mortality rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_mortality_rate) (4 per 1,000 [live births](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_birth_(human))). In 2019, the principal cause of death was cardiovascular disease, at 37%.[265] [Obesity in Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity_in_Germany) has been increasingly cited as a major health issue: a 2014 study showed that 52 percent of the adult German population was overweight or obese.[266]


## Culture

Culture in German states has been shaped by major intellectual and popular currents in Europe, both religious and [secular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism), and [its scientists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_and_technology_in_Germany), [writers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_literature) and [philosophers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_philosophy) have played a significant role in the development of Western thought.[267] Global opinion polls from the [BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC) revealed that Germany is recognised for having the most positive influence in the world in 2013[268] and 2014.[269]

Germany is well known for such folk festivals as the [Oktoberfest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oktoberfest) and [Christmas customs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weihnachten), which include [Advent wreaths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_wreath), [Christmas pageants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nativity_play), [Christmas trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_tree), [Stollen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stollen) cakes, and other practices.[270][271] As of 2024, [UNESCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO) inscribed [54 properties in Germany on the World Heritage List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Sites_in_Germany).[272] There are a number of [public holidays in Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holidays_in_Germany) determined by each state; 3 October has been a [national day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_day) of Germany since 1990, celebrated as the Tag der Deutschen Einheit ([German Unity Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Unity_Day)).[273]


### Music

German [classical music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_music_era) includes works by some of the world's most well-known composers. [Dieterich Buxtehude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieterich_Buxtehude), [Johann Sebastian Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach) and [Georg Friedrich Händel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Frideric_Handel) were influential composers of the [Baroque period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroque_music). [Ludwig van Beethoven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven) was a crucial figure in the transition between the Classical and [Romantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_music) eras. [Carl Maria von Weber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Maria_von_Weber), [Felix Mendelssohn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Mendelssohn), [Robert Schumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Schumann) and [Johannes Brahms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Brahms) were significant Romantic composers. [Richard Wagner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wagner) was known for his operas. [Richard Strauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Strauss) was a leading composer of the late Romantic and early [modern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th-century_classical_music) eras. [Karlheinz Stockhausen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karlheinz_Stockhausen) and [Wolfgang Rihm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Rihm) are important composers of the 20th and early 21st centuries.[274]

In 2013, Germany was the second-largest music market in Europe, and [fourth-largest in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_recorded_music_markets).[275] German popular music of the 20th and 21st centuries includes the movements of [Neue Deutsche Welle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neue_Deutsche_Welle), [pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music), [Ostrock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrock), [heavy metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music)/[rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_rock), [punk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_punk), [pop rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_rock), [indie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_rock), [Volksmusik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volksmusik) (folk music), [schlager pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schlager_music) and [German hip hop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_hip_hop). German [electronic music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music) gained global influence, with [Kraftwerk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraftwerk) and [Tangerine Dream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangerine_Dream) pioneering in this genre.[276] DJs and artists of the [techno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techno) and [house music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_music) scenes of Germany have become well known (e.g. [Paul van Dyk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_van_Dyk), [Felix Jaehn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Jaehn), [Paul Kalkbrenner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Kalkbrenner), [Robin Schulz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Schulz) and [Scooter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooter_(band))).[277]


### Art, design and architecture

German painters have influenced [Western art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_of_Europe). [Albrecht Dürer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer), [Hans Holbein the Younger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Holbein_the_Younger), [Matthias Grünewald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthias_Gr%C3%BCnewald) and [Lucas Cranach the Elder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Cranach_the_Elder) were important German artists of the [Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance), [Johann Baptist Zimmermann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Baptist_Zimmermann) of the [Baroque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroque), [Caspar David Friedrich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspar_David_Friedrich) and [Carl Spitzweg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Spitzweg) of [Romanticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism), [Max Liebermann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Liebermann) of [Impressionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressionism) and [Max Ernst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Ernst) of [Surrealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealism). Several German art groups formed in the 20th century; [Die Brücke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Br%C3%BCcke) (The Bridge) and [Der Blaue Reiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Blaue_Reiter) (The Blue Rider) influenced the development of [expressionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Expressionism) in Munich and Berlin. The [New Objectivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Objectivity) arose in response to expressionism during the Weimar Republic. After World War II, broad trends in German art include [neo-expressionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-expressionism) and the [New Leipzig School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Leipzig_School).[278]

German designers became early leaders of modern [product design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_design).[279] The [Berlin Fashion Week](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Fashion_Week) and the fashion trade fair [Bread & Butter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread_%26_Butter_(tradeshow)) are held twice a year.[280]

Architectural contributions from Germany include the [Carolingian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_architecture) and [Ottonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottonian_architecture) styles, which were precursors of [Romanesque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanesque_architecture). [Brick Gothic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_Gothic) is a distinctive medieval style that evolved in Germany. Also in [Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_architecture) and [Baroque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroque_architecture) art, regional and typically German elements evolved (e.g. [Weser Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weser_Renaissance)).[278] [Vernacular architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernacular_architecture) in Germany is often identified by [its timber framing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fachwerkhaus) (Fachwerk) traditions and varies across regions, and among carpentry styles.[281] When industrialisation spread across Europe, [classicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classicism) and a distinctive style of [historicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicism_(art)) developed in Germany, sometimes referred to as [Gründerzeit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%BCnderzeit) style. [Expressionist architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expressionist_architecture) developed in the 1910s in Germany and influenced [Art Deco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Deco) and other modern styles. Germany was particularly important in the early [modernist movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_architecture): it is the home of [Werkbund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutscher_Werkbund) initiated by [Hermann Muthesius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Muthesius) ([New Objectivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Objectivity_(architecture))), and of the [Bauhaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauhaus) movement founded by [Walter Gropius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Gropius).[278] [Ludwig Mies van der Rohe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Mies_van_der_Rohe) became one of the world's most renowned architects in the second half of the 20th century; he conceived of the glass façade [skyscraper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyscraper).[282] Renowned contemporary [architects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_German_architects) and offices include [Pritzker Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pritzker_Prize) winners [Gottfried Böhm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_B%C3%B6hm) and [Frei Otto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frei_Otto).[283]


### Literature and philosophy

German literature can be traced back to the Middle Ages and the works of writers such as [Walther von der Vogelweide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walther_von_der_Vogelweide) and [Wolfram von Eschenbach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfram_von_Eschenbach). Well-known German authors include [Johann Wolfgang von Goethe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe), [Friedrich Schiller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Schiller), [Gotthold Ephraim Lessing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotthold_Ephraim_Lessing) and [Theodor Fontane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Fontane). The collections of folk tales published by the [Brothers Grimm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brothers_Grimm) popularised [German folklore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_folklore) on an international level.[284] The Grimms also gathered and codified regional variants of the German language, grounding their work in historical principles; their [Deutsches Wörterbuch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsches_W%C3%B6rterbuch), or German Dictionary, sometimes called the Grimm dictionary, was begun in 1838 and the first volumes published in 1854.[285]

Influential authors of the 20th century include [Gerhart Hauptmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerhart_Hauptmann), [Thomas Mann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Mann), [Hermann Hesse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Hesse), [Heinrich Böll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_B%C3%B6ll), and [Günter Grass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%BCnter_Grass).[286] The German book market is the third-largest in the world, after the United States and China.[287] The [Frankfurt Book Fair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_Book_Fair) is the most important in the world for international deals and trading, with a tradition spanning over 500 years.[288] The [Leipzig Book Fair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leipzig_Book_Fair) also retains a major position in Europe.[289]

German philosophy is historically significant: [Gottfried Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz)'s contributions to [rationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationalism); the [enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment) philosophy by [Immanuel Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant); the establishment of classical [German idealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_idealism) by [Johann Gottlieb Fichte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Gottlieb_Fichte), [Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel) and [Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Wilhelm_Joseph_Schelling); [Arthur Schopenhauer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer)'s composition of metaphysical pessimism; the formulation of [communist theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_theory) by [Karl Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx) and [Friedrich Engels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Engels); [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche)'s development of [perspectivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspectivism); [Gottlob Frege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottlob_Frege)'s contributions to the dawn of [analytic philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_philosophy); [Martin Heidegger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Heidegger)'s works on Being; [Oswald Spengler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oswald_Spengler)'s historical philosophy; and the development of the [Frankfurt School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_School) have all been very influential.[290]

German cinema has made major technical and artistic contributions to film. The first works of the [Skladanowsky Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Skladanowsky) were shown to an audience in 1895. The renowned [Babelsberg Studio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babelsberg_Studio) in [Potsdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potsdam) was established in 1912, thus being the first large-scale film studio in the world. Early German cinema was particularly influential with [German expressionists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_expressionist_cinema) such as [Robert Wiene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Wiene) and [Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Wilhelm_Murnau). Director [Fritz Lang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Lang)'s [Metropolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_(1927_film)) (1927) is referred to as the first major science-fiction film. After 1945, many of the films of the immediate post-war period can be characterised as [Trümmerfilm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubble_film) (rubble film). East German film was dominated by the state-owned film studio [DEFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFA_(film_studio)), while the dominant genre in West Germany was the [Heimatfilm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heimatfilm) ("homeland film").[295] During the 1970s and 1980s, [New German Cinema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_German_Cinema) directors such as [Volker Schlöndorff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volker_Schl%C3%B6ndorff), [Werner Herzog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Herzog), [Wim Wenders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wim_Wenders), and [Rainer Werner Fassbinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainer_Werner_Fassbinder) brought West German auteur cinema to critical acclaim.

The [Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Foreign_Language_Film) ("Oscar") went to the German production [The Tin Drum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tin_Drum_(film)) (Die Blechtrommel) in 1979, to [Nowhere in Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nowhere_in_Africa) (Nirgendwo in Afrika) in 2002, and to [The Lives of Others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lives_of_Others) (Das Leben der Anderen) in 2007. [Various Germans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_German-speaking_Academy_Award_winners_and_nominees) won an Oscar for their performances in other films. The annual [European Film Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Film_Award) ceremony is held every other year in Berlin, home of the [European Film Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Film_Academy). The [Berlin International Film Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_International_Film_Festival), known as "Berlinale", awarding the "[Golden Bear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Bear)" and held annually since 1951, is one of the world's leading [film festivals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_festival). The "Lolas" are annually awarded in Berlin, at the [German Film Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutscher_Filmpreis).[296]


### Cuisine

German cuisine varies from region to region and often neighbouring regions share some culinary similarities, including with the southern regions of [Bavaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavarian_cuisine) and [Swabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swabian_cuisine), [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland), and [Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria).

## Notes

1. ^ From 1952 to 1990, the entire "Das Lied der Deutschen" was the national anthem, but only the third verse was sung on official occasions. Since 1991, the third verse alone has been the national anthem.[1]
1. ^ Berlin is the sole constitutional capital and de jure seat of government, but the former provisional capital of the Federal Republic of Germany, [Bonn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonn), has the special title of "federal city" (Bundesstadt) and is the primary seat of six ministries.[2]

1. ^ The Bundesrat is sometimes referred to as an upper chamber of the German legislature. This is technically incorrect, since the [German Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Law_for_the_Federal_Republic_of_Germany) defines the Bundestag and Bundesrat as two separate legislative institutions. Hence, the federal legislature of Germany consists of two unicameral legislative institutions, not one bicameral parliament.
