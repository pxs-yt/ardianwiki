# The Human Brain

The **human brain** is the central organ of the nervous system, responsible for cognition, emotion, sensory processing, and motor control. Weighing approximately 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds) in adults, it contains about 86 billion neurons and an equal number of glial cells, forming a network of 100 trillion synaptic connections. As of March 01, 2025, advances in neuroscience have deepened our understanding of its structure, function, and plasticity, making it a focal point for medical research, artificial intelligence, and philosophy.

## Anatomy

The brain resides within the skull, protected by the meninges (dura mater, arachnoid mater, pia mater) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which cushions it against trauma. It is divided into three primary regions:

- **Forebrain (Prosencephalon)**: Includes the cerebrum, thalamus, and hypothalamus. The cerebrum, the largest part, splits into two hemispheres connected by the corpus callosum, a 200-million-fiber bundle.
- **Midbrain (Mesencephalon)**: A small region managing reflexes, eye movement, and dopamine production via the substantia nigra.
- **Hindbrain (Rhombencephalon)**: Comprises the cerebellum, pons, and medulla oblongata, controlling balance, breathing, and heart rate.

### Cerebral Cortex

The cerebrum’s outer layer, the cerebral cortex, is a 2–4 mm thick sheet of gray matter with 16 billion neurons. Its wrinkled surface (gyri and sulci) spans 2,500 cm² when unfolded. It divides into four lobes:
- **Frontal Lobe**: Governs reasoning, planning, and voluntary movement. The prefrontal cortex, 29% of the cortex, handles executive functions.
- **Parietal Lobe**: Processes touch, temperature, and spatial awareness via the somatosensory cortex.
- **Temporal Lobe**: Manages auditory perception, memory (hippocampus), and language comprehension (Wernicke’s area).
- **Occipital Lobe**: Dedicated to vision, with the primary visual cortex (V1) mapping retinal input.

### Subcortical Structures

Beneath the cortex lie critical structures:
- **Thalamus**: A relay station for sensory and motor signals, with 50 nuclei processing 90% of sensory input.
- **Hypothalamus**: Regulates hunger, thirst, sleep, and hormones via the pituitary gland (e.g., oxytocin release).
- **Basal Ganglia**: Coordinates movement and reward, including the striatum, globus pallidus, and subthalamic nucleus.
- **Limbic System**: Drives emotion and memory, with the amygdala (fear processing) and hippocampus (spatial memory, 1,000 new neurons/day in adults).

### Cerebellum and Brainstem

The cerebellum, with 69 billion neurons (80% of the brain’s total), fine-tunes motor skills and contributes to cognitive tasks like attention. The brainstem, a 10 cm stalk, sustains life: the medulla oblongata controls heart rate (60–100 bpm) and breathing (12–20 breaths/min), while the pons relays signals between cortex and cerebellum.

## Physiology

Neurons communicate via electrical impulses (action potentials, -70 mV to +40 mV) and chemical neurotransmitters (e.g., dopamine, serotonin) across synapses. The brain consumes 20% of the body’s energy—300–500 kcal/day—despite being 2% of body weight, fueled by glucose and oxygen delivered via 150,000 km of capillaries.

### Neural Plasticity

The brain adapts through plasticity:
- **Synaptic Plasticity**: Long-term potentiation (LTP) strengthens connections, as in learning (e.g., 10,000 repetitions for motor skills).
- **Neurogenesis**: Adults generate 700 new neurons daily in the hippocampus, aiding memory and mood regulation.

### Brain Waves

Electroencephalography (EEG) measures brain activity:
- **Delta (0.5–4 Hz)**: Deep sleep, 50–200 µV amplitude.
- **Theta (4–8 Hz)**: Meditation, creativity.
- **Alpha (8–13 Hz)**: Relaxed wakefulness.
- **Beta (13–30 Hz)**: Active focus.
- **Gamma (30–100 Hz)**: Problem-solving, peaks at 40 Hz.

## Functions

The brain orchestrates:
- **Cognition**: Problem-solving, language (Broca’s area for speech production), and abstract thought (e.g., 100,000 words in an average vocabulary).
- **Sensory Processing**: Integrates 11 million bits/second (vision: 10 million, hearing: 1 million).
- **Motor Control**: The motor cortex maps muscles, with 100 ms latency for reflexes.
- **Emotion**: The amygdala processes 80 emotions/minute, while the insula senses disgust.

## Development and Aging

The brain develops from the neural tube at 3 weeks gestation, reaching 100 billion neurons by birth (250,000/minute formed in utero). Pruning reduces this to 86 billion by adulthood, refining circuits. Aging shrinks the brain 5% per decade after 40, though plasticity persists—e.g., 2025 studies show 70-year-olds learning languages via neurofeedback.

## Disorders

Disorders affect 1 billion people globally:
- **Alzheimer’s**: 50 million cases (2025), with amyloid plaques and tau tangles shrinking the hippocampus 10%/year.
- **Parkinson’s**: 10 million, dopamine loss in the substantia nigra slows movement (0.5 m/s gait reduction).
- **Stroke**: 15 million/year, 80% ischemic, cutting blood flow (4.5-hour treatment window).
- **Depression**: 300 million, serotonin imbalance alters prefrontal-hippocampal circuits.

## Research and Technology

By 2025, neuroscience advances include:
- **Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs)**: Neuralink’s 1,024-electrode implants decode 50 words/minute in trials.
- **Imaging**: fMRI maps 1 mm³ regions, while 7T MRI resolves 0.1 mm detail.
- **Optogenetics**: Light-activated neurons (500 nm wavelength) reveal circuits in mice, applied to humans by 2025.

## Cultural and Philosophical Impact

The brain shapes identity—“I think, therefore I am” (Descartes)—and inspires art (e.g., Van Gogh’s neural-inspired swirls). Neuroethics debates free will, with 2025 studies showing decisions precede awareness by 0.5 seconds.
