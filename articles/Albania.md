# Albania

Albania (/ælˈbeɪniə, ɔːl-/ ⓘ a(w)l-BAY-nee-ə; [Albanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_language): Shqipëri or Shqipëria),[a] officially the Republic of Albania (Albanian: Republika e Shqipërisë),[b] is a country in [Southeast Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Europe). It is located in the [Balkans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans), on the [Adriatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adriatic_Sea) and [Ionian Seas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionian_Sea) within the [Mediterranean Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea), and shares [land borders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_border) with [Montenegro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montenegro) to the northwest, [Kosovo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo) to the northeast, [North Macedonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Macedonia) to the east and [Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece) to the south. With an area of 28,748 km2 (11,100 sq mi), it has a varied range of climatic, geological, hydrological and morphological conditions. Albania's landscapes range from rugged snow-capped mountains in the [Albanian Alps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accursed_Mountains) and the [Korab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korab), [Skanderbeg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Mountain_Range,_Albania#Skanderbeg_Mountains), [Pindus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pindus) and [Ceraunian Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceraunian_Mountains), to fertile lowland plains extending from the [Adriatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Adriatic_Sea_Coast) and [Ionian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Ionian_Sea_Coast) seacoasts. [Tirana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirana) is the capital and largest city in the country, followed by [Durrës](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durr%C3%ABs), [Vlorë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlor%C3%AB), and [Shkodër](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shkod%C3%ABr).

In ancient times, the [Illyrians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illyrians) inhabited northern and central regions of Albania, whilst [Epirotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epirotes) inhabited the south. Several important ancient [Greek colonies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_colonisation) were also established on the coast. The [Illyrian kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illyrian_kingdom) centred in what is now Albania was the dominant power before the [rise of Macedon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rise_of_Macedon).[7] In the 2nd century BC, the [Roman Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic) annexed the region, and after the division of the [Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire) it became part of [Byzantium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire). The first known [Albanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanians) autonomous principality, [Arbanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbanon), was established in the 12th century. The [Kingdom of Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Albania_(medieval)), [Principality of Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Albania_(medieval)) and [Albania Veneta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania_Veneta) were formed between the 13th and 15th centuries in different parts of the country, alongside other Albanian principalities and political entities. In the late 15th century, Albania [became part](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Albania) of the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire). In 1912, the modern Albanian state [declared independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_independence_of_Albania). In 1939, [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Italy) invaded the [Kingdom of Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Albania_(1928%E2%80%9339)), which became [Greater Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Kingdom_(1939%E2%80%9343)), and then a [protectorate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Kingdom_(1943%E2%80%9344)) of [Nazi Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany) during [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II).[8] After the war, the [People's Socialist Republic of Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Socialist_Republic_of_Albania) was formed, which lasted until the [Revolutions of 1991](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1989) concluded with the [fall of communism in Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_communism_in_Albania) and eventually the establishment of the current Republic of Albania.

Since its independence in 1912, Albania has undergone a diverse political evolution, transitioning from a [monarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy) to a [communist regime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism) before becoming a [sovereign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state) [parliamentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_republic) [constitutional republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_republic). Governed by a [constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Albania) prioritising the separation of powers, the country's political structure includes a [parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Albania), a ceremonial [president](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Albania), a functional [prime minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Albania) and a hierarchy of courts. Albania is a [developing country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country) with an [upper-middle income](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GNI_(nominal,_Atlas_method)_per_capita#Upper-middle-income_group) [economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Albania) driven by the service sector, with manufacturing and [tourism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism_in_Albania) also playing significant roles.[9] After the dissolution of its communist system the country shifted from [centralised planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_economy) to an [open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_market) [market economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_economy).[10] Albanian citizens have [universal health care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_health_care) access and free primary and secondary education. The country is an official candidate for membership in the European Union.


## Etymology

The historical origins of the term "Albania" can be traced back to [medieval Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Latin), with its foundations believed to be associated with the [Illyrian tribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illyrian_tribe) of the [Albani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albani_(Illyrian_tribe)). This connection gains further support from the work of the Ancient Greek geographer [Ptolemy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy) during the 2nd century AD, where he included the settlement of [Albanopolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanopolis) situated to the northeast of [Durrës](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durr%C3%ABs).[11][12] The presence of a medieval settlement named [Albanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Arbanon) or Arbanon hints at the possibility of historical continuity. The precise relationship among these historical references and the question of whether Albanopolis was synonymous with Albanon remain subjects of scholarly debate.[13]

The Byzantine historian [Michael Attaliates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Attaliates), in his 11th-century historical account, provides the earliest undisputed reference to the Albanians, when he mentions them having taken part in a revolt against [Constantinople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople) in 1079.[14] He also identifies the Arbanitai as subjects of the Duke of [Dyrrachium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durr%C3%ABs).[15] In the Middle Ages, Albania was denoted as Arbëri or Arbëni by its inhabitants, who identified themselves as Arbëreshë or Arbëneshë.[16] Albanians employ the terms Shqipëri or Shqipëria for their nation, designations that trace their historical origins to the 14th century.[17] But only in the late 17th and early 18th centuries did these terms gradually supersede Arbëria and Arbëreshë among Albanians.[17][18] These two expressions are widely interpreted to symbolise "Children of the Eagles" and "Land of the Eagles".[19][20]


## History


### Prehistory

Mesolithic habitation in Albania has been evidenced in several open air sites which during that period were close to the Adriatic coastline and in cave sites. Mesolithic objects found in a cave near Xarrë include [flint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flint) and [jasper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasper) objects along with fossilised animal bones, while those discoveries at Mount Dajt comprise bone and stone tools similar to those of the [Aurignacian culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurignacian_culture).[21] The [Neolithic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic) era in Albania began around 7000 BC and is evidenced in finds which indicate domestication of sheep and goats and small-scale agriculture. A part of the Neolithic population may have been the same as the Mesolithic population of the southern Balkans like in the [Konispol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konispol) cave where the Mesolithic stratum co-exists with Pre-Pottery Neolithic finds. [Cardium pottery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardium_pottery) culture appears in coastal Albania and across the Adriatic after 6500 BC, while the settlements of the interior took part in the processes which formed the [Starčevo culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star%C4%8Devo_culture).[22] The Albanian [bitumen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitumen) mines of [Selenicë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenic%C3%AB) provide early evidence of bitumen exploitation in Europe, dating to Late Neolithic Albania (from 5000 BC), when local communities used it as pigment for ceramic decoration, [waterproofing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterproofing), and [adhesive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive) for reparing broken vessels. The bitumen of Selenicë circulated towards eastern Albania from the early 5th millennium BC. First evidence of its overseas trade export comes from Neolithic and Bronze Age southern [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy). The high-quality bitumen of Selenicë has been exploited throughout all the historical ages since the Late Neolithic era until today.[23]

The [Indo-Europeanisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_migrations) of Albania in the context of the IE-isation of the western Balkans began after 2800 BC. The presence of the Early Bronze Age [tumuli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumulus) in the vicinity of later [Apollonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonia_(Illyria)) dates to 2679±174 calBC (2852-2505 calBC). These burial mounds belong to the southern expression of the Adriatic-Ljubljana culture (related to later [Cetina culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetina_culture)) which moved southwards along the Adriatic from the northern Balkans. The same community built similar mounds in Montenegro (Rakića Kuće) and northern Albania (Shtoj).[24] The first [archaeogenetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeogenetics) find related to the IE-isation of Albania involves a man with predominantly [Yamnaya ancestry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Steppe_Herders) buried in a tumulus of northeastern Albania which dates to 2663–2472 calBC.[25] During the Middle Bronze Age, Cetina culture sites and finds appear in Albania. Cetina culture moved southwards across the Adriatic from the [Cetina valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetina) of [Dalmatia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalmatia). In Albania, Cetina finds are concentrated around southern [Lake Shkodër](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Shkod%C3%ABr) and appear typically in tumulus cemeteries like in Shkrel and Shtoj and hillforts like Gajtan (Shkodër) as well as cave sites like Blaz, Nezir and Keputa (central Albania) and lake basin sites like Sovjan (southeastern Albania).[26]


### Antiquity

The incorporated territory of Albania was historically inhabited by [Indo-European peoples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_people), amongst them numerous [Illyrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illyrian_tribes) and [Epirote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epirus_(ancient_state)) tribes. There were also several [Greek colonies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_colonization). The territory referred to as [Illyria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illyria) corresponded roughly to the area east of the [Adriatic Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adriatic_Sea) in the [Mediterranean Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea) extending in the south to the mouth of the [Vjosë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vjos%C3%AB).[27][28] The first account of the Illyrian groups comes from [Periplus of the Euxine Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periplus_of_the_Euxine_Sea), a Greek text written in the 4th century BC.[29] The [Bryges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryges) were also present in central Albania, while the south was inhabited by the Epirote [Chaonians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaonians), whose capital was at [Phoenice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenice).[29][30][31] Other colonies such as [Apollonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonia_(Illyria)) and [Epidamnos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidamnos) were established by Greek city-states on the coast by the 7th century BC.[29][32][33]

The Illyrian [Taulanti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taulantii) were a powerful Illyrian tribe that were among the earliest recorded tribes in the area. They lived in an area that corresponds much of present-day Albania. Together with the Dardanian ruler [Cleitus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleitus_(son_of_Bardylis)), [Glaucias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucias_of_Taulantii), the ruler of the Taulantian kingdom, fought against [Alexander the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great) at the [Battle of Pelium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Pelium) in 335 BC. As the time passed, the ruler of Ancient Macedonia, [Cassander of Macedon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassander) captured Apollonia and crossed the river [Genusus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shkumbin) ([Albanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_language): Shkumbin) in 314 BC. A few years later Glaucias laid siege to Apollonia and captured the Greek colony of [Epidamnos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidamnos).[34]

The Illyrian [Ardiaei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardiaei) tribe, centred in Montenegro, ruled over most of the territory of northern Albania. Their [Ardiaean Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardiaean_Kingdom) reached its greatest extent under [King Agron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agron_of_Illyria), the son of [Pleuratus II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleuratus_II). Agron extended his rule over other neighbouring tribes as well.[35] Following Agron's death in 230 BC, his wife, [Teuta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teuta), inherited the Ardiaean kingdom. Teuta's forces extended their operations further southwards to the Ionian Sea.[36] In 229 BC, Rome declared war[37] on the kingdom for extensively plundering Roman ships. The war ended in Illyrian defeat in 227 BC. Teuta was eventually succeeded by [Gentius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentius) in 181 BC.[38] Gentius clashed with the Romans in 168 BC, initiating the [Third Illyrian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Illyrian_War). The conflict resulted in Roman conquest of the region by 167 BC. The Romans split the region into three administrative divisions.[39]


### Middle Ages

The [Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire) was split in 395 upon the death of [Theodosius I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodosius_I) into an [Eastern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Roman_Empire) and [Western Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Roman_Empire) in part because of the increasing pressure from threats during the [Barbarian Invasions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbarian_Invasions). From the 6th century into the 7th century, the [Slavs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Slavs) crossed the [Danube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danube) and largely absorbed the indigenous Greeks, Illyrians and Thracians in the [Balkans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans); thus, the Illyrians were mentioned for the last time in historical records in the 7th century.[40][41]

In the 11th century, the [Great Schism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Schism_of_1054) formalised the break of communion between the [Eastern Orthodox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church) and [Western Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Catholic_Church) that is reflected in Albania through the emergence of a Catholic north and Orthodox south. The Albanian people inhabited the west of [Lake Ochrida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Ochrida) and the upper valley of [River Shkumbin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shkumbin) and established the [Principality of Arbanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Arbanon) in 1190 under the leadership of [Progon of Kruja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progon_of_Kruja).[42] The realm was succeeded by his sons [Gjin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gjin_Progoni) and Dhimitri.

Upon the death of Dhimiter, the territory came under the rule of the Albanian-Greek [Gregory Kamonas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Kamonas) and subsequently under the [Golem of Kruja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem_of_Kruja).[43][44][45] In the 13th century, the principality was dissolved.[46][47][48] Arbanon is considered to be the first sketch of an Albanian state, that retained a [semi-autonomous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-autonomous) status as the western extremity of the [Byzantine Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire), under the Byzantine [Doukai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doukas) of [Epirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Despotate_of_Epirus) or [Laskarids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laskaris) of [Nicaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Nicaea).[49]

Towards the end of the 12th and beginning of the 13th centuries, [Serbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Serbia_(medieval)) and [Venetians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetian_Empire) started to take possession over the territory.[50] The [ethnogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnogenesis) of the Albanians is uncertain; however, the first undisputed mention of Albanians dates back in historical records from 1079 or 1080 in a work by [Michael Attaliates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Attaliates), who referred to the [Albanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanoi) as having taken part in a revolt against [Constantinople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople).[51] At this point the Albanians were fully Christianised.

After the dissolution of Arbanon, [Charles of Anjou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_Naples) concluded an agreement with the Albanian rulers, promising to protect them and their ancient liberties. In 1272, he established the [Kingdom of Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Albania_(medieval)) and conquered regions back from the [Despotate of Epirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Despotate_of_Epirus). The kingdom claimed all of central Albania territory from [Dyrrhachium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyrrhachium) along the Adriatic Sea coast down to [Butrint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butrint). A Catholic political structure was a basis for the papal plans of spreading [Catholicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholicism) in the Balkan Peninsula. This plan found also the support of [Helen of Anjou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_of_Anjou), a cousin of Charles of Anjou. Around 30 Catholic churches and monasteries were built during her rule mainly in northern Albania.[52] Internal power struggles within the Byzantine Empire in the 14th century enabled Serbs' most powerful medieval ruler, [Stefan Dusan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Dusan), to establish a [short-lived empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_Empire) that included all of Albania except Durrës.[50]

In 1367, Albanian rulers established the [Despotate of Arta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Despotate_of_Arta). During that time, several [Albanian principalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_principalities) were created, notably the [Principality of Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Albania_(medieval)), [Principality of Kastrioti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Kastrioti), [Lordship of Berat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lordship_of_Berat) and [Principality of Dukagjini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Dukagjini). In the first half of the 15th century, the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire) invaded most of Albania, and the [League of Lezhë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Lezh%C3%AB) was held under [Skanderbeg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skanderbeg) as a ruler, who became the national hero of the Albanian medieval history.


#### Ottoman Empire

With the [fall of Constantinople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Constantinople), the Ottoman Empire continued an extended period of conquest and expansion with its borders going deep into [Southeast Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_conquest_of_the_Balkans). They reached the [Albanian Ionian Sea Coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Ionian_Sea_Coast) in 1385 and erected their garrisons across [Southern Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Albania) in 1415 and then occupied most of Albania in 1431.[53][54] Thousands of Albanians consequently fled to Western Europe, particularly to [Calabria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabria), [Naples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Naples), [Ragusa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ragusa) and [Sicily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Sicily), whereby others sought protection at the often inaccessible [Mountains of Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_Albania).[55][56] The Albanians, as Christians, were considered an [inferior class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayah) of people, and as such they were subjected to heavy [taxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jizya) among others by the [Devshirme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devshirme) system that allowed the [Sultan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan) to collect a requisite percentage of Christian adolescents from their families to compose the [Janissary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janissary).[57] The Ottoman conquest was also accompanied with the gradual process of [Islamisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamisation) and the rapid construction of mosques.

A prosperous and longstanding revolution erupted after the formation of the [League of Lezhë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Lezh%C3%AB) until the [fall of Shkodër](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Shkodra) under the leadership of [Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gjergj_Kastrioti_Skanderbeg), who consistently defeated major Ottoman armies led by [Sultans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan) [Murad II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murad_II) and [Mehmed II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmed_II). Skanderbeg managed to unite several of the Albanian principalities, amongst them the [Arianitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianiti_family), [Dukagjinis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukagjini_family), [Zaharias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaharia_family) and [Thopias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thopia_family), and establish a centralised authority over most of the non-conquered territories, becoming the [Lord of Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skanderbeg).[58] The Ottoman Empire's expansion ground to a halt during the time that Skanderbeg's forces resisted, and he has been credited with being one of the main reasons for the delay of Ottoman expansion into [Western Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Europe), giving the Italian principalities more time to better prepare for the [Ottoman arrival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Otranto).[59] However, the failure of most European nations, with the exception of Naples, in giving him support, along with the failure of Pope Pius II's plans to organise a promised crusade against the Ottomans meant that none of Skanderbeg's victories permanently hindered the Ottomans from invading the Western Balkans.[60][61]

Despite his brilliance as a military leader, Skanderbeg's victories were only delaying the final conquests. The constant Ottoman invasions caused enormous destruction to Albania, greatly reducing the population and destroying flocks of livestock and crops. Besides surrender, there was no possible way Skanderbeg would be able to halt the Ottoman invasions despite his successes against them. His manpower and resources were insufficient, preventing him from expanding the war efforts and driving the Turks from the Albanian borders. Albania was therefore doomed to face an unending series of Ottoman attacks until it eventually fell years after his death.[62]

When the Ottomans were gaining a firm foothold in the region, Albanian towns were organised into four principal [sanjaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjaks). The government fostered trade by settling a sizeable Jewish colony of refugees fleeing persecution in Spain. The city of [Vlorë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlor%C3%AB) saw passing through its ports imported merchandise from Europe such as velvets, cotton goods, mohairs, carpets, spices and leather from [Bursa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bursa) and [Constantinople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople). Some citizens of Vlorë even had business associates throughout Europe.[63]

The phenomenon of Islamisation among the Albanians became primarily widespread from the 17th century and continued into the 18th century.[64] Islam offered them equal opportunities and advancement within the Ottoman Empire. However, motives for conversion were, according to some scholars, diverse depending on the context though the lack of source material does not help when investigating such issues.[64] Because of increasing suppression of Catholicism, most Catholic Albanians converted in the 17th century, while Orthodox Albanians followed suit mainly in the following century.

Since the Albanians were seen as strategically important, they made up a significant proportion of the [Ottoman military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_military) and bureaucracy. Many Muslim Albanians attained important political and military positions and culturally contributed to the broader [Muslim world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_world).[64] Enjoying this privileged position, they held various high administrative positions with over two dozen Albanian [Grand Viziers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Viziers). Others included members of the prominent [Köprülü family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6pr%C3%BCl%C3%BC_family), [Zagan Pasha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zagan_Pasha), [Muhammad Ali of Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_of_Egypt) and [Ali Pasha of Tepelena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Pasha_of_Tepelena). Furthermore, two sultans, [Bayezid II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayezid_II) and [Mehmed III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmed_III), both had mothers of Albanian origin.[63][65][66]


### Rilindja

The [Albanian Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Renaissance) was a period with its roots in the late 18th century and continuing into the 19th century, during which the Albanian people gathered spiritual and intellectual strength for an independent cultural and political life within an [independent nation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Albania). Modern [Albanian culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_culture) flourished too, especially [Albanian literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_literature) and [arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_art), and was frequently linked to the influences of the [Romanticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism) and [Enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment) principles.[68] Prior to the [rise of nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rise_of_nationalism_in_the_Ottoman_Empire), Ottoman authorities suppressed any expression of national unity or conscience by the Albanian people.

The victory of Russia over the Ottoman Empire following the [Russian-Ottoman Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian-Ottoman_War) resulted the execution of the [Treaty of San Stefano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_San_Stefano) which assigned Albanian-populated lands to their Slavic and Greek neighbours. However, the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland) and [Austro-Hungarian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austro-Hungarian_Empire) consequently blocked the arrangement and caused the [Treaty of Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Berlin_(1878)). From this point, Albanians started to organise themselves with the goal to protect and unite the Albanian-populated lands into a unitary nation, leading to the formation of the [League of Prizren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Prizren). The league had initially the assistance of the Ottoman authorities whose position was based on the religious solidarity of Muslim people and landlords connected with the [Ottoman administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Porte). They favoured and protected the Muslim solidarity and called for defence of Muslim lands simultaneously constituting the reason for titling the league [Committee of the Real Muslims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Prizren#Formation).[69]

Approximately 300 Muslims participated in the assembly composed by delegates from Bosnia, the [administrator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjakbey) of the [Sanjak of Prizren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjak_of_Prizren) as representatives of the central authorities and no delegates from [Vilayet of Scutari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilayet_of_Scutari).[70] Signed by only 47 Muslim deputies, the league issued the [Kararname](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kararname_(League_of_Prizren)) that contained a proclamation that the people from northern Albania, [Epirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epirus) and [Bosnia and Herzegovina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina) are willing to defend the [territorial integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_integrity) of the Ottoman Empire by all possible means against the troops of [Bulgaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Bulgaria), [Serbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Serbia) and [Montenegro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Montenegro).[71]

Ottomans authorities cancelled their assistance when the league, under [Abdyl Frashëri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdyl_Frash%C3%ABri), became focused on working towards Albanian autonomy and requested merging four [vilayets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_vilayet), including [Kosovo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo_Vilayet), [Shkodër](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scutari_Vilayet), [Monastir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastir_Vilayet) and [Ioannina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janina_Vilayet), into a unified vilayet, the [Albanian Vilayet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Vilayet). The league used military force to prevent the annexing areas of [Plav](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plav_Municipality) and [Gusinje](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gusinje) assigned to Montenegro. After several successful battles with Montenegrin troops, such as the [Battle of Novšiće](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Nov%C5%A1i%C4%87e), the league was forced to retreat from their contested regions. The league was later defeated by the Ottoman army sent by the sultan.[72]


#### Independence

Albania [declared independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Declaration_of_Independence) from the Ottoman Empire on 28 November 1912, accompanied by the establishment of the [Senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_Albania) and [Government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Government_of_Albania) by the [Assembly of Vlorë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_of_Vlor%C3%AB) on 4 December 1912.[73][74][75][76] Its sovereignty was recognised by the [Conference of London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Conference_of_1912%E2%80%931913). On 29 July 1913, the [Treaty of London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_London_(1913)) delineated the borders of the country and its neighbors, leaving many Albanians outside Albania, predominantly [partitioned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(politics)) between [Montenegro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Montenegro), [Serbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Serbia), and [Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Greece).[77]

Headquartered in Vlorë, the [International Commission of Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Commission_of_Control) was established on 15 October 1913 to take care of the administration of Albania until its own political institutions were in order.[78][79] The [International Gendarmerie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Gendarmerie) was established as the [Principality of Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Albania)'s first law enforcement agency. In November, the first gendarmerie members arrived in the country. Prince of Albania [Wilhelm of Wied](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_of_Wied) (Princ Vilhelm Vidi) was selected as the first prince of the principality.[80] On 7 March, he arrived in the provisional capital of [Durrës](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durr%C3%ABs) and began to organise his government, appointing [Turhan Pasha Përmeti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turhan_Pasha_P%C3%ABrmeti) to form the first Albanian cabinet.

In November 1913, the Albanian pro-Ottoman forces had offered the throne of Albania to the Ottoman war minister of Albanian origin, [Ahmed Izzet Pasha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Izzet_Pasha).[81] The pro-Ottoman peasants believed that the new regime was a tool of the six Christian [Great Powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Power) and local landowners, who owned half of the arable land.[82]

In February 1914, the [Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_Republic_of_Northern_Epirus) was proclaimed in [Gjirokastër](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gjirokast%C3%ABr) by the local [Greek population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks_in_Albania) against incorporation to Albania. This initiative was short-lived, and in 1921 the southern provinces were incorporated into the Albanian Principality.[83][84] Meanwhile, the [revolt of Albanian peasants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peasant_Revolt_in_Albania) against the new regime erupted under the leadership of the group of Muslim clerics gathered around [Essad Pasha Toptani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essad_Pasha_Toptani), who proclaimed himself the savior of Albania and Islam.[85][86] To gain the support of the [Mirdita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirdita) Catholic volunteers from northern Albania, Prince [Wied](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_of_Wied) appointed their leader, [Prênk Bibë Doda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pr%C3%AAnk_Bib%C3%AB_Doda), foreign minister of the Principality of Albania. In May and June 1914, the International Gendarmerie was joined by [Isa Boletini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isa_Boletini) and his men, mostly from [Kosovo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo),[87] and the rebels defeated northern [Mirdita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirdita) Catholics, capturing most of Central Albania by the end of August 1914.[88] Prince Wied's regime collapsed, and he left the country on 3 September 1914.[89]


### First Republic

The [interwar period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interwar_period) in Albania was marked by persistent economic and social difficulties, political instability and foreign interventions.[90][91] After [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I), Albania lacked an established government and internationally recognised borders, rendering it vulnerable to neighboring entities such as Greece, Italy, and Yugoslavia, all of which sought to expand their influence.[90] This led to political uncertainty, highlighted in 1918 when the [Congress of Durrës](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Durr%C3%ABs) sought [Paris Peace Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Peace_Conference_(1919%E2%80%931920)) protection but was denied, further complicating Albania's position on the international stage. Territorial tensions escalated as Yugoslavia, particularly Serbia, sought control of northern Albania, while Greece aimed dominance in southern Albania. The situation deteriorated in 1919 when the Serbs launched attacks on Albanian inhabitants, among others in [Gusinje](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gusinje) and [Plav](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plav,_Montenegro), resulting in [massacres and large-scale displacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plav%E2%80%93Gusinje_massacres_(1912%E2%80%931913)).[90][92][93] Meanwhile, Italian influence continued to expand during this time, driven by economic interests and political ambitions.[91][94]

[Fan Noli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_Noli), renowned for his [idealism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism), became prime minister in 1924, with a vision to institute a Western-style constitutional government, abolish feudalism, counter Italian influence, and enhance critical sectors, including infrastructure, education and healthcare.[90] He faced resistance from former allies, who had assisted in the removal of [Zog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zog_I_of_Albania) from power, and struggled to secure foreign aid to implement his agenda. Noli's decision to establish diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union, an adversary of the Serbian elite, ignited allegations of [bolshevism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolshevism) from Belgrade.[90] This in turn led to increased pressure from Italy and culminated in Zog's restoration to authority. In 1928, Zog transitioned Albania from a republic to a monarchy that garnered backing from [Fascist Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascist_Italy_(1922%E2%80%931943)), with Zog assuming the title of King Zog I. Key constitutional changes dissolved the Senate and established a unicameral National Assembly while preserving Zog's authoritative powers.[90]

In 1939, Italy under [Benito Mussolini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini) launched a military invasion of Albania, resulting to the exile of Zog and the creation of an [Italian protectorate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_protectorate_of_Albania_(1939%E2%80%931943)).[95][96] As [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II) progressed, Italy aimed to expand its territorial dominion in the Balkans, including territorial claims on regions of Greece ([Chameria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chameria)), Macedonia, Montenegro and Kosovo. These ambitions laid the foundation of [Greater Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_protectorate_of_Albania_(1939%E2%80%931943)), which aimed to unite all areas with Albanian-majority populations into a single country.[97] In 1943, as Italy's control declined, [Nazi Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany) assumed control of Albania, subjecting Albanians to forced labour, economic exploitation and repression under [German rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_occupation_of_Albania).[98] The tide shifted in 1944 when Albanian partisan forces, under the leadership of [Enver Hoxha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enver_Hoxha) and other communist leaders, successfully liberated Albania from German occupation.[99]


### Communism

The establishment of the [People's Republic of Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Socialist_Republic_of_Albania) under the leadership of [Enver Hoxha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enver_Hoxha) was a significant epoch in modern Albanian history.[100] Hoxha's regime embraced [Marxist–Leninist ideologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism) and implemented [authoritarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism) policies, including prohibition of religious practices, severe restrictions on travel, and abolition of private property rights.[101] It was also defined by a persistent pattern of purges, extensive repression, instances of betrayal, and hostility to external influences.[101] Any form of opposition or resistance to his rule was met with expeditious and severe consequences, such as internal exile, extended imprisonment, and execution.[101] The regime confronted a multitude of challenges, including widespread poverty, illiteracy, health crises and gender inequality.[99] In response, Hoxha initiated a modernisation initiative aimed at attaining economic and social liberation and transforming Albania into an industrial society.[99] The regime placed a high priority on the diversification of the economy through Soviet-style industrialisation, comprehensive infrastructure development such as the introduction of a transformative [railway system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hekurudha_Shqiptare), expansion of education and healthcare services, elimination of adult illiteracy, and targeted advancements in areas such as women's rights.[102][103][104][105]

Albania's diplomatic history under Hoxha was characterised by notable conflicts.[90] Initially aligned with Yugoslavia as a satellite state, the relationship deteriorated as Yugoslavia aimed to incorporate Albania within its territory.[90] Subsequently, Albania established relations with the Soviet Union and engaged trade agreements with other Eastern European countries, but experienced disagreements over Soviet policies, leading to strained ties with Moscow and diplomatic separation in 1961.[90] Simultaneously, tensions with the West heightened due to Albania's refusal to hold free elections and allegations of Western support for [anti-communist uprisings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-communism). Albania's enduring partnership was with China; it sided with Beijing during the [Sino-Soviet conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Soviet_split), resulting in severed ties with the Soviet Union and withdrawal from the [Warsaw Pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Pact) in response to the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. But their relations stagnated in 1970, prompting both to reassess their commitment, and Albania actively reduced its dependence on China.[90]

Under Hoxha's regime, Albania underwent a widespread campaign targeting religious clergy of various faiths, resulting in public persecution and executions, particularly targeting Muslims, Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox adherents.[90] In 1946, religious estates underwent nationalisation, coinciding with the closure or transformation of religious institutions into various other purposes.[90] This culminated in 1976, when Albania became the world's first constitutionally atheist state.[107] Under this regime, citizens were forced to renounce their religious beliefs, adopt a secular way of life, and embrace socialist ideology.[90][107]


### Fourth Republic

After four decades of communism paired with the [revolutions of 1989](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1989), Albania witnessed a notable rise in political activism, particularly among students, which led to a transformation in the prevailing order. After the first [multi-party elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-party_elections) of [1991](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_parliamentary_election,_1991), the communist party maintained a stronghold in the parliament until its defeat in the [parliamentary elections of 1992](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_parliamentary_election,_1992) directed by the [Democratic Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_of_Albania).[108] Considerable economic and financial resources were devoted to [pyramid schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_schemes_in_Albania) that were widely supported by the government. The schemes swept up somewhere between one sixth and one third of the population of the country.[109][110] Despite the [International Monetary Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund)'s warnings, [Sali Berisha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sali_Berisha) defended the schemes as large investment firms, leading more people to redirect their remittances and sell their homes and cattle for cash to deposit in the schemes.[111]

The schemes began to collapse in late 1996, leading many of the investors to join initially peaceful protests against the government, requesting their money back. The protests turned violent in February 1997 as government forces responded by firing on the demonstrators. In March, the Police and Republican Guard deserted, leaving their armories open. These were promptly emptied by militias and criminal gangs. The resulting [civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Albanian_civil_unrest) caused a wave of evacuations of foreign nationals and refugees.[112]

The crisis led both [Aleksandër Meksi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksand%C3%ABr_Meksi) and [Sali Berisha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sali_Berisha) to resign from office in the wake of the general election. In April 1997, [Operation Alba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Alba), a U.N. peacekeeping force led by Italy, entered Albania with two goals: to assist with the evacuation of expatriates and secure the ground for international organisations. The main international organisation involved was the [Western European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_European_Union)'s [multinational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_civil_war_of_1997#International_intervention) [Albanian Police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Police) element, which worked with the government to restructure the [judicial system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_system_of_Albania) and simultaneously the Albanian police.


### Contemporary

After its [communist system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Albania) disintegrated, Albania embarked on an active path towards [Westernisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westernization) with the ambition to obtain membership in the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union) (EU) and the [North Atlantic Treaty Organisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization) (NATO).[114] A notable milestone was reached in 2009, when the country attained [membership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania%E2%80%93NATO_relations) in NATO, marking a pioneering achievement among the nations of [Southeast Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Europe).[115][116] In adherence to its vision for further integration into the EU, it [formally applied](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accession_of_Albania_to_the_European_Union) for membership on 28 April 2009.[117] Another milestone was reached on 24 June 2014, when the country was granted [official candidate status](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_enlargement_of_the_European_Union).[118]

[Edi Rama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edi_Rama) of the [Socialist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Party_of_Albania) won both the [2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_parliamentary_election,_2013) and [2017 parliamentary elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_parliamentary_election,_2017). As [prime minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Albania), he implemented numerous reforms focused on [modernising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernism) the [economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Albania), as well as democratising state institutions, including the [judiciary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary_of_Albania) and [law enforcement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_in_Albania). Unemployment has steadily declined, with Albania achieving the 4th-lowest [unemployment rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_unemployment_rate) in the Balkans.[119] Rama has also placed [gender equality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_equality) at the centre of his agenda; since 2017 almost 50% of the ministers have been female, the largest number of women serving in the country's history.[120] During the [2021 parliamentary elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Albanian_parliamentary_election), the ruling Socialist Party led by Rama secured its third consecutive victory, winning nearly half of votes and enough seats in parliament to govern alone.[121][122]

On 26 November 2019, a 6.4 [magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_magnitude_scale) [earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake) ravaged Albania, with the [epicentre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicentre) about 16 km (10 mi) southwest of the town of [Mamurras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamurras).[123] The tremor was felt in [Tirana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirana) and in places as far away as [Taranto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taranto), Italy, and [Belgrade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade), Serbia, while the most affected areas were the coastal city of [Durrës](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durr%C3%ABs) and the village of [Kodër-Thumanë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kod%C3%ABr-Thuman%C3%AB).[124] Comprehensive response to the earthquake included substantial humanitarian aid from the [Albanian diaspora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_diaspora) and various countries [around the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Albania_earthquake#International_assistance).[125]

On 9 March 2020, [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Albania) was confirmed to have spread to Albania.[126][127] From March to June 2020, the government declared a [state of emergency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency) as a measure to limit the virus's spread.[128][129][130] The country's COVID-19 [vaccination campaign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccination_in_Albania) started on 11 January 2021, but as of 11 August 2021, the total number of vaccines administered in Albania was 1,280,239 doses.[131][132]

On 21 September 2024, it was reported that Prime Minister Rama was planning to create the [Sovereign State of the Bektashi Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_State_of_the_Bektashi_Order), a sovereign [microstate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microstate) for the Order within Tirana.[133]


## Environment


### Geography

Albania lies along the [Mediterranean Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea) on the [Balkan Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan_Peninsula) in [South](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Europe) and [Southeast Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Europe), and has an area of 28,748 km2 (11,100 sq mi).[134] It is bordered by the [Adriatic Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adriatic_Sea) to the west, [Montenegro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montenegro) to the northwest, [Kosovo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo) to the northeast, [North Macedonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Macedonia) to the east, [Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece) to the south, and the [Ionian Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionian_Sea) to the southwest. It is between latitudes [42°](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42nd_parallel_north) and [39° N](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/39th_parallel_north) and longitudes [21°](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21st_meridian_east) and [19° E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/19th_meridian_east). Geographic coordinates include [Vërmosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%ABrmosh) at 42° 35' 34" northern latitude as the northernmost point, [Konispol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konispol) at 39° 40' 0" northern latitude as the southernmost, [Sazan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sazan_Island) at 19° 16' 50" eastern longitude as the westernmost, and [Vërnik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C3%ABrnik) at 21° 1' 26" eastern longitude as the easternmost.[135] [Mount Korab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Korab), rising at 2,764 m (9,068.24 ft) [above the Adriatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metres_above_the_Adriatic), is the highest point, while the Mediterranean Sea, at 0 m (0.00 ft), is the lowest. The country extends 148 km (92 mi) from east to west and around 340 km (211 mi) from north to south.

Albania has a diverse and varied landscape with mountains and hills that traverse its territory in various directions. The country is home to extensive mountain ranges, including the [Albanian Alps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Alps) in the north, the [Korab Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korab) in the east, the [Pindus Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pindus_Mountains) in the southeast, the [Ceraunian Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceraunian_Mountains) in the southwest, and the [Skanderbeg Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skanderbeg_Mountains) in the centre. In the northwest is the [Lake of Shkodër](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_of_Shkod%C3%ABr), Southern Europe's largest lake.[136] Towards the [southeast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Ohrid_Lake_Coast) emerges the [Lake of Ohrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_of_Ohrid), one of the world's oldest continuously existing lakes.[137] Farther south, the expanse includes the [Large](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prespa_Lake) and [Small Lake of Prespa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Prespa_Lake), some of the Balkans' highest lakes. Rivers rise mostly in the east and discharge into the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The country's longest river, measured from mouth to source, is the [Drin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drin_River), which starts at the confluence of its two headwaters, the [Black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Drin) and [White Drin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Drin). Of particular concern is the [Vjosë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vjos%C3%AB), one of Europe's last intact large river systems.

In Albania [forest cover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_cover) is around 29.% of the total land area, equivalent to 788,900 hectares (ha) of forest in 2020, up from 788,800 hectares (ha) in 1990. Of the naturally regenerating forest 11% was reported to be [primary forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_forest) (consisting of native tree species with no clearly visible indications of human activity) and around 0% of the forest area was found within protected areas. For the year 2015, 97% of the forest area was reported to be under [public ownership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_ownership), 3% [private ownership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property) and 0% with ownership listed as other or unknown.[138][139]

The [climate of Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_Albania) exhibits a distinguished level of variability and diversity due to the differences in latitude, longitude and altitude.[140][141] Albania experiences a [Mediterranean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_climate) and [Continental climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_climate), characterised by the presence of four distinct seasons.[142] According to the [Köppen classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification), Albania encompasses five primary climatic types, spanning from Mediterranean and [subtropical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humid_subtropical_climate) in the western half to [oceanic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_climate), [continental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humid_continental_climate) and [subarctic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subarctic_climate) in the eastern half of the country.[143] The coastal regions along the [Adriatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Adriatic_Sea_Coast) and [Ionian Seas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Ionian_Sea_Coast) in Albania are acknowledged as the warmest areas, while the northern and eastern regions encompassing the [Albanian Alps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Alps) and the [Korab Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korab_Mountains) are recognised as the coldest areas in the country.[144] Throughout the year, the average monthly temperatures fluctuate, ranging from −1 [°C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius) (30 [°F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit)) during the winter months to 21.8 °C (71.2 °F) in the summer months. Notably, the highest recorded temperature of 43.9 °C (111.0 °F) was observed in [Kuçovë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku%C3%A7ov%C3%AB) on 18 July 1973, while the lowest temperature of −29 °C (−20 °F) was recorded in Shtyllë, [Librazhd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Librazhd) on 9 January 2017.[145][146]

Albania receives most of the [precipitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(meteorology)) in winter months and less in summer months.[141] The average precipitation is about 1,485 millimetres (58.5 inches).[144] The mean annual precipitation ranges between 600 and 3,000 millimetres (24 and 118 inches) depending on geographical location.[142] The [northwestern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Mountain_Range_(Albania)) and [southeastern highlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Mountain_Range_(Albania)) receive the intenser amount of precipitation, whilst the [northeastern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Mountain_Range_(Albania)) and [southwestern highlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Mountain_Range_(Albania)) as well as the [Western Lowlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Lowlands) the more limited amount.[144] The [Albanian Alps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Alps) in the far north of the country are considered to be among the most humid regions of Europe, receiving at least 3,100 mm (122.0 in) of rain annually.[144] Four [glaciers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacier) within these mountains were discovered at a relatively low altitude of 2,000 metres (6,600 ft), which is extremely rare for such a southerly latitude.[147]


### Biodiversity

A [biodiversity hotspot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity_hotspot), Albania possesses an exceptionally rich and contrasting [biodiversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity) on account of its geographical location at the centre of the [Mediterranean Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea) and the great diversity in its [climatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatic), geological and [hydrological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrological) conditions.[148][149] Because of remoteness, the mountains and hills of Albania are endowed with forests, trees and grasses that are essential to the lives for a wide variety of animals, among others for two of the most [endangered species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species) of the country, the [lynx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan_lynx) and [brown bear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_bear), as well as the [wildcat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcat), [grey wolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_wolf), [red fox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_fox), [golden jackal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_jackal), [Egyptian vulture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_vulture) and [golden eagle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_eagle), the latter constituting the national animal of the country.[150][151][152][153]

The estuaries, wetlands and lakes are extraordinarily important for the [greater flamingo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_flamingo), [pygmy cormorant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmy_cormorant) and the extremely rare and perhaps the most iconic bird of the country, the [dalmatian pelican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalmatian_pelican).[154] Of particular importance are the [Mediterranean monk seal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_monk_seal), [loggerhead sea turtle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loggerhead_sea_turtle) and [green sea turtle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_sea_turtle) that use to nest on the country's coastal waters and shores.

In terms of [phytogeography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytogeography), Albania is part of the [Boreal Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boreal_Kingdom) and stretches specifically within the [Illyrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illyria) province of the [Circumboreal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumboreal_Region) and [Mediterranean Region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Basin). Its territory can be subdivided into four terrestrial [ecoregions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecoregion) of the [Palearctic realm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palearctic_realm) namely within the [Illyrian deciduous forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illyrian_deciduous_forests), [Balkan mixed forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan_mixed_forests), [Pindus Mountains mixed forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pindus_Mountains_mixed_forests) and [Dinaric Mountains mixed forests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinaric_Mountains_mixed_forests).[155][156]

Approximately 3,500 different species of plants can be found in Albania which refers principally to a [Mediterranean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean) and [Eurasian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia) character. The country maintains a vibrant tradition of herbal and medicinal practices. At the minimum 300 plants growing locally are used in the preparation of herbs and medicines.[157] The trees within the forests are primarily [fir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fir), [oak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak), [beech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beech) and [pine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine).


## Conservation

Albania has been an active participant in numerous international agreements and conventions aimed at strengthing its commitment to the preservation and sustainable management of biological diversity. Since 1994, the country is a party to the [Convention on Biological Diversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_Biological_Diversity) (CBD) and its associated [Cartagena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartagena_Protocol_on_Biosafety) and [Nagoya Protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagoya_Protocol).[158] To uphold these commitments, it has developed and implemented a comprehensive [National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity_action_plan) (NBSAP).[158] Furthermore, Albania has established a partnership with the [International Union for Conservation of Nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature) (IUCN), advancing its conservation efforts on both national and international scales. Guided by the IUCN, the country has made substantial progress in the foundation of [protected areas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_area) within its boundaries, encompassing 12 [national parks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_park) among others [Butrint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butrint_National_Park), [Karaburun-Sazan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaburun-Sazan_Marine_Park), [Llogara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llogara_National_Park), [Prespa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prespa_National_Park_(Albania)) and [Vjosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vjosa_Wild_River_National_Park).[159]

As a signatory to the [Ramsar Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsar_Convention), Albania has granted special recognition upon four wetlands, designating them as Wetlands of International Importance, including [Buna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buna_(Adriatic_Sea))-[Shkodër](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Skadar), [Butrint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butrint_Lagoon), [Karavasta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karavasta_Lagoon) and [Prespa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Prespa).[160] The country's dedication to protection extends further into the sphere of [UNESCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO)'s [World Network of Biosphere Reserves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Network_of_Biosphere_Reserves), operating within the framework of the [Man and the Biosphere Programme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_and_the_Biosphere_Programme), evidenced by its engagement in the [Ohrid-Prespa Transboundary Biosphere Reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohrid-Prespa_Transboundary_Biosphere_Reserve).[161][162] Furthermore, Albania is host to two natural [World Heritage Sites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site), which encompass the Ohrid region and both the [Gashi River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gashi_River) and [Rrajca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rrajce) as part of [Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_and_Primeval_Beech_Forests_of_the_Carpathians_and_Other_Regions_of_Europe).[163]


### Protected areas

The [protected areas of Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_areas_of_Albania) are areas designated and managed by the [Albanian government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_government). There are 12 [national parks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_park), 4 [ramsar sites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsar_site), 1 [biosphere reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosphere_reserve) and 786 other types of conservation reserves in Albania.[159][164] Located in the north, the Albanian Alps National Park, comprising the former [Theth National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theth_National_Park) and [Valbonë Valley National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valbon%C3%AB_Valley_National_Park), is surrounded amidst the towering peaks of the [Albanian Alps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accursed_Mountains). In the east, portions of the rugged [Korab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korab), [Nemërçka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nem%C3%ABr%C3%A7ka) and [Shebenik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebenik) Mountains are conserved within the boundaries of [Fir of Hotovë-Dangëlli National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fir_of_Hotov%C3%AB-Dang%C3%ABlli_National_Park), [Shebenik National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebenik_National_Park) and [Prespa National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prespa_National_Park_(Albania)), with the latter encompassing Albania's share of the [Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prespa_Lake) and [Small Lakes of Prespa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Prespa_Lake).

To the south, the [Ceraunian Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceraunian_Mountains) define the [Albanian Ionian Sea Coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Ionian_Sea_Coast), shaping the landscape of [Llogara National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llogara_National_Park), which extends into the [Karaburun Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaburun_Peninsula,_Albania), forming the [Karaburun-Sazan Marine Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaburun-Sazan_Marine_Park). Further southward lies [Butrint National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butrint_National_Park), occupying a peninsula surrounded by the Lake of Butrint and the [Channel of Vivari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_of_Vivari). In the west, stretching along the [Albanian Adriatic Sea Coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Adriatic_Sea_Coast), the [Divjakë-Karavasta National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divjak%C3%AB-Karavasta_National_Park) boasts the extensive [Lagoon of Karavasta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagoon_of_Karavasta), one of the largest lagoon systems in the Mediterranean Sea. Notably, Europe's first wild river national park, [Vjosa National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vjosa_Wild_River_National_Park), safeguards the [Vjosa River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vjosa) and its primary tributaries, which originates in the [Pindus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pindus) Mountains and flows to the Adriatic Sea. [Dajti Mountain National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dajti_Mountain_National_Park), [Lurë-Dejë Mountain National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lur%C3%AB-Dej%C3%AB_Mountain_National_Park) and [Tomorr Mountain National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomorr_Mountain_National_Park) protect the mountainous terrain of the centre of Albania, including the [Tomorr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomorr) and [Skanderbeg Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skanderbeg_Mountains).


### Environmental issues

Environmental issues in Albania notably encompass [air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution) and [water pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_pollution), [climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_Albania) impacts, [waste management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_management) shortcomings, [biodiversity loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology) and imperative for [nature conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_conservation).[165][166]

Climate change is predicted to exert significant impacts on the quality of life in Albania.[167] Albania is one of the European countries most at risk and vulnerable to [natural disasters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster).[168] Natural disasters, such as [floods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood), [forest fires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire), and [landslides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide), are increasing in Albania due to climate change, causing significant damage.[169][170] Rising sea levels are anticipated to negatively impact coastal communities and the tourism industry.[171]

In 2023 Albania emitted 7.67 million tonnes of [greenhouse gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas),[172] equivalent to 2.73 tonnes per person,[173] making it a relatively low emitting country. Albania has pledged a 20.9% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030, and [net zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net-zero_emissions) by 2050.[174]

The country has a moderate and improving performance in the [Environmental Performance Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_Performance_Index) with an overall ranking of 62 out of 180 countries in 2022.[175] However, Albania's ranking has decreased since its highest placement at position 15 in the Environmental Performance Index of 2012.[176]

Since declaring independence in 1912, Albania has experienced a significant political transformation, traversing through distinct periods that included a monarchical rule, a communist regime and the eventual establishment of a democratic order.[177] In 1998, Albania transitioned into a [sovereign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state) [parliamentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_republic) [constitutional republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_republic), marking a fundamental milestone in its political evolution.[178] Its governance structure operates under a [constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Albania) that serves as the principal document of the country.[179] The constitution is grounded in the principle of the [separation of powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers), with three arms of government that encompass the legislative embodied in the [Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Albania), the executive led by the [President](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Albania) as the ceremonial [head of state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state) and the [Prime Minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Albania) as the functional [head of government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_government), and the judiciary with a hierarchy of courts, including the [constitutional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Court_of_Albania) and [supreme courts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Albania) as well as multiple [appeal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeals_courts_of_Albania) and [administrative courts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_Courts_in_Albania).[178]

Albania's legal system is structured to protect its people's political rights, regardless of their ethnic, linguistic, racial, or religious affiliations.[178][180] Despite these principles, there are significant human rights concerns in Albania that demand attention.[181] These concerns include issues related to the independence of the judiciary, the absence of a free media sector and the enduring problem of corruption within various governmental bodies, law enforcement agencies and other institutions.[181] As Albania pursues its path towards EU membership, active efforts are being made to achieve substantial improvements in these areas to align with EU criteria and standards.[180]


### Foreign relations

Emerging from decades of isolation during the communism, Albania has adopted a [foreign policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_relations_of_Albania) orientation centred on active cooperation and engagement in international affairs. At the core of Albania's foreign policies lie a set of objectives, which encompass the commitment to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity, the cultivation of diplomatic ties with other countries, advocating for [international recognition of Kosovo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_recognition_of_Kosovo), addressing the concerns related to the [expulsion of Cham Albanians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expulsion_of_Cham_Albanians), pursuing Euro-Atlantic integration and protecting the rights of the Albanians in [Kosovo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanians_in_Kosovo), [Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanians_in_greece), [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arb%C3%ABresh%C3%AB_people), [Montenegro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanians_in_Montenegro), [North Macedonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanians_in_Macedonia), [Serbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanians_in_south_Serbia) and the [diaspora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_diaspora).[183]

The external affairs of Albania underscore the country's dedication to regional stability and integration into major international institutions.[184] Albania became a member of the [United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations) (UN) in 1955, shortly after emerging from a period of isolation during the communist era.[185] The country reached a major achievement in its foreign policy by securing NATO membership in 2009.[186][187] Since obtaining candidate status in 2014, the country has also embarked on a comprehensive reform agenda to align itself with European Union (EU) accession standards, with the objective of becoming an EU member state.[118]

Albania and Kosovo maintain a fraternal relationship strengthened by their substantial cultural, ethnical and historical ties.[188] Both countries foster enduring diplomatic ties, with Albania actively supporting Kosovo's development and international integration efforts.[188] Its fundamental contribution to [Kosovo's path to independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Kosovo_declaration_of_independence) is underscored by its early [recognition of Kosovo's sovereignty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_recognition_of_Kosovo) in 2008.[189] Furthermore, both governments hold annual joint meetings, displayed by the inaugural meeting in 2014, which serves as an official platform to enhance bilateral cooperation and reinforce their joint commitment to policies that promote the stability and prosperity of the broader Albanian region.[188]


### Military

The [Albanian Armed Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Armed_Forces) consist of [Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Land_Force), [Air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Air_Force) and [Naval Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Naval_Force) and constitute the military and paramilitary forces of the country. They are led by a [commander-in-chief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander-in-chief) under the supervision of the [Ministry of Defence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Albania)) and by the [President](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Albania) as the supreme commander during wartime. However, in times of peace its powers are executed through the [Prime Minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Albania) and the [Defence Minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Albania)).[190]

The chief purpose of the armed forces of Albania is the defence of the independence, the [sovereignty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty) and the [territorial integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_integrity) of the country, as well as the participation in humanitarian, combat, non-combat and peace support operations.[190] [Military service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_service) is voluntary since 2010 with the age of 19 being the legal minimum age for the duty.[191][192]

Albania has committed to increase the participations in multinational operations.[193] Since the fall of communism, the country has participated in six international missions but only one United Nations mission in [Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNOMIG), where it sent three military observers. Since February 2008, Albania has participated officially in NATO's [Operation Active Endeavor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Active_Endeavor) in the [Mediterranean Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea).[194] It was invited to join NATO on 3 April 2008, and it became a full member on 2 April 2009.[195]

Albania reduced the number of active troops from 65,000 in 1988 to 14,500 in 2009.[196][197] The military now consists mainly of a small fleet of aircraft and sea vessels. Increasing the military budget was one of the most important conditions for [NATO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO) integration. As of 1996 military spending was an estimated 1.5% of the country's GDP, only to peak in 2009 at 2% and fall again to 1.5%.[198]


## Administrative divisions

Albania is defined within a territorial area of 28,748 km2 (11,100 sq mi) in the [Balkan Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan_Peninsula). It is informally divided into three regions, the [Northern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Albania), [Central](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Albania) and [Southern Regions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Albania). Since [its Declaration of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Declaration_of_Independence) in 1912, Albania has reformed [its internal organisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_Albania#History) 21 times. Presently, the primary [administrative units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_Albania) are the twelve constituent [counties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counties_of_Albania) (qarqe/qarqet), which hold equal status under the law.[199] Counties had previously been used in the 1950s and were recreated on 31 July 2000 to unify the 36 [districts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Albania) (rrathë/rrathët) of that time.[200][201] The largest county in Albania by population is [Tirana County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirana_County) with over 800,000 people. The smallest county, by population, is [Gjirokastër County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gjirokast%C3%ABr_County) with over 70,000 people. The largest county, by area, is [Korçë County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kor%C3%A7%C3%AB_County) encompassing 3,711 square kilometres (1,433 sq mi) of the southeast of Albania. The smallest county, by area, is [Durrës County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durr%C3%ABs_County) with an area of 766 square kilometres (296 sq mi) in the west of Albania.

The counties are made up of 61 second-level divisions known as [municipalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipalities_of_Albania) (bashki/bashkia).[202] The municipalities are the first level of local governance, responsible for local needs and [law enforcement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_in_Albania).[203][204][205] They unified and simplified the previous system of [urban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_municipalities_of_Albania) and [rural municipalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_municipalities_of_Albania) or [communes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communes_of_Albania) (komuna/komunat) in 2015.[206][207] For smaller issues of [local government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government), the municipalities are organised into 373 [administrative units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_units_of_Albania) (njësia/njësitë administrative). There are also 2980 villages (fshatra/fshatrat), neighborhoods or wards (lagje/lagjet), and localities (lokalitete/lokalitetet) previously used as administrative units.

## Economy

Albania's transition from a socialist [planned economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_economy) to a capitalist [mixed economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_economy) has been largely successful.[210] The country has a [developing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country) mixed economy classified by the [World Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank) as an [upper-middle income economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GNI_(nominal,_Atlas_method)_per_capita#Upper-middle-income_group). In 2016, it had the fourth-lowest [unemployment rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_unemployment_rate) in the [Balkans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans) with an estimated value of 14.7%. Its largest trading partners are Italy, Greece, China, Spain, Kosovo and the United States. The [lek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_lek) (ALL) is the country's currency and is [pegged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_exchange_rate) at approximately 132.51 lek per euro.

The cities of [Tirana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirana) and [Durrës](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durr%C3%ABs) constitute the economic and financial heart of Albania due to their high population, modern infrastructure and strategic geographical location. The country's most important infrastructure facilities take course through both of the cities, connecting the north to the south as well as the west to the east. Among the largest [companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_companies_of_Albania) are the energy distribution public company [OSHEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operatori_i_Shp%C3%ABrndarjes_s%C3%AB_Energjis%C3%AB_Elektrike), steel producer Kurum, oil cdompanies like Kastrati, [Albpetrol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albpetrol), and [ARMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARMO_oil_refiner), the mineral [AlbChrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlbChrome), the investment [BALFIN Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samir_Mane) and the telecommunications companies [One Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albtelecom) and [Vodafone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vodafone_Albania).[211]

In 2012, Albania's [GDP per capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP_per_capita) stood at 30% of the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union) average, while [GDP (PPP) per capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP_(PPP)_per_capita) was 35%.[212] In the first quarter of 2010, after the [Great Recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession), Albania was one of three countries in Europe to record economic growth.[213][214] The [International Monetary Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund) predicted 2.6% growth for Albania in 2010 and 3.2% in 2011.[215] According to [Forbes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes), as of December 2016, the [Gross Domestic Product (GDP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_Domestic_Product_(GDP)) was growing at 2.8%. The country had a [trade balance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_balance) of −9.7% and [unemployment rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment_rate) of 14.7%.[216] [Foreign direct investment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_direct_investment) has increased significantly in recent years as the government has embarked on an ambitious programme to improve the business climate through fiscal and legislative reforms.


### Primary sector

Agriculture in the country is based on small to medium-sized family-owned dispersed units. It remains a significant sector of the [economy of Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Albania). It employs 41%[217] of the population, and about 24.31% of the land is used for agricultural purposes. One of the earliest farming sites in Europe has been found in the southeast of the country.[218] As part of the pre-accession process of Albania to the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union), farmers are being aided through [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrument_for_Pre-Accession_Assistance) funds to improve Albanian agriculture standards.[219]

Albania produces significant amounts of fruits (apples, [olives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive), grapes, oranges, lemons, [apricots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apricot), [peaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peach), [cherries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry), [figs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figs), [sour cherries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prunus_cerasus), [plums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plum), and [strawberries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strawberry)), [vegetables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable_oil) (potatoes, tomatoes, [maize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize), onions, and wheat), [sugar beets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_beet), tobacco, meat, [honey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey), [dairy products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_product), traditional medicine and [aromatic plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_oil). Further, the country is a worldwide significant producer of [salvia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvia), [rosemary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosemary) and [yellow gentian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentiana_lutea).[220] The country's proximity to the [Ionian Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionian_Sea) and the [Adriatic Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adriatic_Sea) give the underdeveloped fishing industry great potential. The [World Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank) and [European Community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Community) economists report that, Albania's fishing industry has good potential to generate export earnings because prices in the nearby Greek and Italian markets are many times higher than those in the Albanian market. The fish available off the coasts of the country are [carp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carp), [trout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trout), [sea bream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_bream), [mussels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mussel) and [crustaceans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean).

Albania has one of Europe's longest histories of [viticulture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viticulture).[221] Today's region was one of the few places where vine was naturally grown during the ice age. The oldest found seeds in the region are 4,000 to 6,000 years old.[222] In 2009, the nation produced an estimated 17,500 tonnes of wine.[223]


### Secondary sector

Albania's secondary sector has undergone many changes and diversification since the communist regime collapsed. It is very diversified, from [electronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics_industry), [manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_industries),[224] [textiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_industry), to [food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_industry), [cement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement_industry), [mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_industry),[225] and [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_industry). The [Antea Cement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antea_Cement) plant in [Fushë-Krujë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fush%C3%AB-Kruj%C3%AB) is considered one of the nation's largest industrial greenfield investments.[226] Albanian oil and gas is one of the most promising, albeit strictly regulated, sectors of its economy. Albania has the [second-largest oil deposits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_proven_oil_reserves) in the [Balkan peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan_peninsula) after [Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania), and the largest [oil reserves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patos-Marinza_Oil_Field)[227] in Europe. The [Albpetrol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albpetrol) company is owned by the Albanian state and monitors the state petroleum agreements in the country. The textile industry has seen an extensive expansion by approaching companies from the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union) (EU) in Albania. According to the [Instituti i Statistikës (INSTAT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Statistics_(Albania)), as of 2016, textile production had an annual growth of 5.3% and an annual turnover of around 1.5 billion euros.[228]

Albania is a significant minerals producer and ranks among the world's leading [chromium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium) producers and exporters.[229] The nation is also a notable producer of copper, nickel, and coal.[230] The [Batra mine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batra_mine), [Bulqizë mine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulqiz%C3%AB_mine), and [Thekna mine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thekna_mine) are among the most recognised Albanian mines still in operation.


### Tertiary sector

The [tertiary sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_sector) represents the fastest growing sector of the country's economy. 36% of the population work in the service sector which contributes to 65% of the country's GDP.[231] Ever since the end of the 20th century, the [banking industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banking_industry) is a major component of the tertiary sector and remains in good conditions overall due to [privatisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatisation) and the commendable [monetary policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy).[232][231]

Previously one of the most [isolated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolationism) and controlled countries in the world, [telecommunication industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunication_industry) represents nowadays another major contributor to the sector. It developed largely through privatisation and subsequent investment by both domestic and foreign investors.[231] [Eagle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_Mobile), [Vodafone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vodafone_Albania) and [Telekom Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telekom_Albania) are the leading [telecommunications service providers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_service_provider) in the country.

Tourism is recognised as an industry of national importance and has been steadily increasing since the beginnings of the 21st century.[233][234] It directly accounted for 8.4% of GDP in 2016 though including indirect contributions pushes the proportion to 26%.[235] In the same year, the country received approximately 4.74 million visitors mostly from across Europe and the United States as well.[236]

The increase of foreign visitors has been dramatic. Albania had only 500,000 visitors in 2005, and an estimated 4.2 million in 2012, an increase of 740 percent. In 2015, summer tourism increased by 25 percent from 2014, according to the country's tourism agency.[237] In 2011, [Lonely Planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonely_Planet) named Albania as a top travel destination,[238] while [The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times) placed Albania as number 4 global tourist destination in 2014.[239]

The bulk of the tourist industry is concentrated along the [Adriatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adriatic) and [Ionian Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionian_Sea) in the west of the country. But the [Albanian Riviera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Riviera) in the southwest has the most scenic and pristine beaches; its coastline has a considerable length of 446 kilometres (277 miles).[240] The coast has a distinctive character, rich in varieties of virgin beaches, capes, coves, covered bays, lagoons, small gravel beaches, sea caves, and many landforms. Some parts of this seaside are very clean ecologically, including unexplored areas, which are very rare within the [Mediterranean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean).[241] Other attractions include the mountainous areas such as the [Albanian Alps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Alps), [Ceraunian Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceraunian_Mountains) and [Korab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korab) Mountains but also the historical cities of [Berat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berat), [Durrës](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durr%C3%ABs), [Gjirokastër](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gjirokast%C3%ABr), [Sarandë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarand%C3%AB), [Shkodër](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shkod%C3%ABr) and [Korçë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kor%C3%A7%C3%AB).


### Transport

Transportation in Albania is managed within the functions of the [Ministry of Infrastructure and Energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Infrastructure_and_Energy_(Albania)) and entities such as the [Albanian Road Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Road_Authority) (ARRSH), responsible for the construction and maintenance of the [highways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highways_in_Albania) and [motorways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorways_in_Albania) in Albania, as well as the [Albanian Aviation Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Aviation_Authority_(Albania)) (AAC), with the responsibility of coordinating civil aviation and airports in the country.

The [international airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirana_International_Airport_N%C3%ABn%C3%AB_Tereza) of [Tirana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirana) is the premier air gateway to the country, and is also the principal hub for Albania's national [flag carrier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_carrier) airline, [Air Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Albania). The airport carried more than 3.3 million passengers in 2019 with connections to many destinations in other countries around [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe), [Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa) and [Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia).[242] The country plans to progressively increase the number of airports especially in the south with possible locations in [Sarandë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarand%C3%AB), [Gjirokastër](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gjirokast%C3%ABr) and [Vlorë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlor%C3%AB_International_Airport).[243]

The [highways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highways_in_Albania) and [motorways in Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorways_in_Albania) are properly maintained and often still under construction and renovation. The [Autostrada 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A1_motorway_(Albania)) (A1) is an integral transportation corridor and the country's longest motorway. It is planned to link [Durrës](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durr%C3%ABs) on the Adriatic Sea across [Pristina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pristina) in Kosovo with the [Pan-European Corridor X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-European_Corridor_X) in Serbia.[244][245] The [Autostrada 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A2_motorway_(Albania)) (A2) is part of the [Adriatic–Ionian Corridor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adriatic%E2%80%93Ionian_motorway) as well as the [Pan-European Corridor VIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-European_Corridor_VIII) and connects [Fier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fier) with [Vlorë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlor%C3%AB).[244] The [Autostrada 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A3_motorway_(Albania)) (A3) is under construction and after its completion will connect [Tirana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirana) and [Elbasan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbasan) with the Pan-European Corridor VIII. When all three corridors are completed, Albania will have an estimated 759 kilometres (472 mi) of highway, linking it with all neighboring countries.

[Durrës](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Durr%C3%ABs) is the busiest and largest [seaport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaport) in the country, followed by [Vlorë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Vlor%C3%AB), [Shëngjin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Sh%C3%ABngjin) and [Sarandë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Sarand%C3%AB). As of 2014, it is as one of the largest passenger ports on the [Adriatic Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adriatic_Sea), with annual passenger volume of about 1.5 million. The principal ports serve a system of ferries connecting Albania with islands and coastal cities in Croatia, Greece, and Italy.

The rail network is administered by the national railway company [Hekurudha Shqiptare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hekurudha_Shqiptare), which was extensively promoted by Hoxha. There has been considerable increase in private car ownership and bus usage while rail use decreased since the end of communism. A new railway line from Tirana and its airport to Durrës is planned. The location of this railway, connecting Albania's most populated urban areas, makes it an important economic development project.[246][247]


## Infrastructure


### Education

In Albania, education is secular, free, [compulsory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_education), and based on three levels.[248][249] The academic year is apportioned into two semesters, beginning in September or October and ending in June or July. [Albanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_language) is the [primary language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_language) of instruction in the country's [academic institutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school).[249] The study of a first [foreign language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_language) is mandatory and taught most often at elementary and bilingual schools.[250] Languages taught in schools are English, Italian, French and German.[250] Albania has a [school life expectancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_life_expectancy) of 16 years and a [literacy rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy_rate) of 98.7%, with 99.2% for men and 98.3% for women.[251][252]

Compulsory primary education is divided into two levels, elementary and secondary school, from grade one to five and six to nine, respectively.[248] Pupils are required to attend school from the age six until they turn 16. Upon successful completion of primary education, all pupils are entitled to attend high schools, specialising in any field, including arts, sports, languages, sciences, and technology.[248]

Tertiary education is optional and has undergone a thorough reformation and restructuring in compliance with the principles of the [Bologna Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna_Process). There are a significant number of private and public [institutions of higher education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutions_of_higher_education) in Albania's major cities.[253][249] Tertiary education is organised into three successive levels, the [bachelor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor%27s_degree), [master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%27s_degree), and [doctorate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctorate_Degree).


### Health

The [constitution of Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Albania) guarantees its citizens equal, free, and [universal health care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_health_care).[255] The health care system is organised into [primary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_healthcare), [secondary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_care), and [tertiary healthcare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_healthcare), and is in a process of modernisation and development.[256][257] The [life expectancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy) at birth in Albania is 77.8 years, ranking [37th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy) in the world and surpassing several [developed countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_countries).[258] The average [healthy life expectancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy#Healthy_life_expectancy) is 68.8 years, ranking 37th in the world.[259] The country's [infant mortality rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_mortality_rate) was estimated at 12 per 1,000 live births in 2015. In 2000, the country had the world's 55th-best healthcare performance, as defined by the [World Health Organisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization) (WHO).[260]

[Cardiovascular disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease) is the principal cause of death in Albania, accounting for 52% of deaths.[256] [Accidents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident), injuries, [malignant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malignant_disease) and [respiratory diseases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease) are other primary causes of death.[256] [Neuropsychiatric disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropsychiatric_disorders) has also increased due to recent demographic, social, and economic changes in the country.[256]

In 2009, Albania had a fruit and vegetable supply of 886 grams per capita per day, the fifth-highest supply in Europe.[261] Compared to other developed and developing countries, Albania has a relatively low rate of [obesity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity), probably thanks to the [Mediterranean diet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_diet).[262][263] According to [2016 WHO data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Body_Mass_Index_(BMI)#WHO_Data_on_Prevalence_of_Obesity_(BMI_above_30)_(2014)), 21.7% of adults in the country are clinically [overweight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overweight), with a [Body mass index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index) (BMI) score of 25 or more.[264]


### Energy

Due to its location and natural resources, Albania has a wide variety of [energy resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_resource), ranging from gas, oil, and coal to [wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_energy), [solar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy), [water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydropower), and other [renewable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy) sources.[265][266] According to the [World Economic Forum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum)'s 2023 Energy Transition Index (ETI), the country ranked 21st globally, highlighting the progress in its energy transition agenda.[267] Currently, Albania's electricity generation sector depends on [hydroelectricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectricity), ranking fifth in the world in percentage terms.[268][269][270] Increasing risks of river floods and droughts due to [climate change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change) is expected to put electricity generation at risk.[271] The [Drin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drin_(river)), in the north, hosts four [hydroelectric power stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectric_power_station), including [Fierza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fierza_Hydroelectric_Power_Station), [Koman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koman_Hydroelectric_Power_Station), [Skavica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skavica_Hydro_Power_Plant) and [Vau i Dejës](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vau_i_Dej%C3%ABs_Hydroelectric_Power_Station). Two other power stations, such as the [Banjë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banj%C3%AB_Hydro_Power_Plant) and [Moglicë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moglic%C3%AB_Hydro_Power_Plant), are along the [Devoll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devoll_(river)) in the south.[272]

Albania has considerable oil deposits. It has the 10th-largest oil reserves in Europe and the 58th in the world.[273] The country's main petroleum deposits are located around the [Albanian Adriatic Sea Coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Adriatic_Sea_Coast) and [Myzeqe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myzeqe) Plain within the [Western Lowlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Lowlands), where the country's largest reserve is located. [Patos-Marinza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patos-Marinza_Oil_Field), also located within the area, is the largest onshore [oil field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_field) in Europe.[274] The [Trans Adriatic Pipeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_Adriatic_Pipeline) (TAP), part of the planned [Southern Gas Corridor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Gas_Corridor), runs for 215 kilometres (134 miles) across Albania's territory before entering the [Albanian Adriatic Sea Coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Adriatic_Sea_Coast) approximately 17 kilometres (11 miles) northwest of [Fier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fier).[275]

Albania's [water resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_resources) are particularly abundant in all the regions of the country and comprise [lakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakes_of_Albania), [rivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivers_of_Albania), springs, and groundwater aquifers.[276] The country's available average quantity of [fresh water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresh_water) is estimated at 129.7 cubic metres (4,580 cubic feet) per inhabitant per year, one of the highest rates in Europe.[277] According to data presented by the [Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Monitoring_Programme_for_Water_Supply_and_Sanitation) (JMP) in 2015, about 93% of the country's total population had access to [improved sanitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improved_sanitation).[278]


### Media

The [freedom of press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_press) and [speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech), and the right to free expression is guaranteed in the [constitution of Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Albania).[279] Albania was ranked 84th on the [Press Freedom Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Freedom_Index) of 2020 compiled by the [Reporters Without Borders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reporters_Without_Borders), with its score steadily declining since 2003.[280] Nevertheless, in the 2020 report of [Freedom in the World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_in_the_World), the [Freedom House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_House) classified the freedoms of press and speech in Albania as partly free from political interference and manipulation.[281]

[Radio Televizioni Shqiptar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Televizioni_Shqiptar) (RTSH) is the [national broadcaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_broadcaster) corporation of Albania operating numerous television and radio stations in the country.[282] The three major private broadcaster corporations are [Top Channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Channel), [Televizioni Klan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Klan) and [Vizion Plus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vizion_Plus) whose content are distributed throughout Albania and beyond its territory in [Kosovo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo) and other [Albanian-speaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_language) territories.

Albanian cinema has its roots in the 20th century and developed after the country's [declaration of independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Declaration_of_Independence).[283] The first [movie theater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_theater) exclusively devoted to showing [motion pictures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_pictures) was built in 1912 in [Shkodër](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shkod%C3%ABr).[283] During the [People's Republic of Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_Albania), Albanian cinema developed rapidly with the inauguration of the [Kinostudio Shqipëria e Re](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinostudio_Shqip%C3%ABria_e_Re) in Tirana.[283] In 1953, the Albanian-Soviet [epic film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_film), the [Great Warrior Skanderbeg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Warrior_Skanderbeg), was released chronicling the life and fight of the medieval Albanian hero [Skanderbeg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gjergj_Kastriot_Skanderbeg). It went on to win the international prize at the [1954 Cannes Film Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Cannes_Film_Festival). In 2003, the [Tirana International Film Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirana_International_Film_Festival) was established, the largest film festival in the country. The [Durrës Amphitheatre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durr%C3%ABs_Amphitheatre) is host to the [Durrës International Film Festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durr%C3%ABs_International_Film_Festival), the second largest film festival.


### Technology

After the [fall of communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_communism_in_Albania) in 1991, human resources in sciences and technology in Albania have drastically decreased. As of various reports, during 1991 to 2005 approximately 50% of the professors and scientists of the universities and science institutions in the country have left Albania.[284] In 2009, the [government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Albania) approved the National Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation in Albania covering the period 2009 to 2015.[285] It aims to triple public spending on [research and development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development) to 0.6% of GDP and augment the share of [GDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_expenditure_on_R%26D) from foreign sources, including the framework programmes for research of the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union), to the point where it covers 40% of research spending, among others. Albania was ranked 84th in the [Global Innovation Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Innovation_Index) in 2024.[286]

Telecommunication represents one of the fastest growing and dynamic sectors in Albania.[287][288] [Vodafone Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vodafone_Albania), [Telekom Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telekom_Albania) and [Albtelecom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albtelecom) are the three large providers of [mobile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_network_operator) and [internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) in Albania.[287] As of the [Electronic and Postal Communications Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_and_Postal_Communications_Authority_(Albania)) (AKEP) in 2018, the country had approximately 2.7 million active mobile users with almost 1.8 million active broadband subscribers.[289] Vodafone Albania alone served more than 931,000 mobile users, Telekom Albania had about 605,000 users and Albtelecom had more than 272,000 users.[289] In [January 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_spaceflight_launches_in_January%E2%80%93June_2023), Albania launched its [first two satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_first_satellites_by_country), Albania 1 and Albania 2, into [orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit), in what was regarded as a milestone effort in monitoring the country's territory and identifying illegal activities.[290][291] Albanian-American engineer [Mira Murati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mira_Murati), the Chief Technology Officer of research organisation [OpenAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI), played a substantial role in the development and launch of artificial intelligence services such as [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT), [Codex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI_Codex) and [DALL-E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DALL-E).[292][293][294] In December 2023, Prime Minister Edi Rama announced plans for collaboration between the Albanian government and ChatGPT, facilitated by discussions with Murati.[295][296] Rama emphasised the intention to streamline the alignment of Albanian laws with the regulations of the European Union, aiming to reduce costs associated with translation and legal services.[295]


## Demography

The demographic statistics of Albania, as revealed by the 2023 census conducted by the [Instituti i Statistikave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Statistics_(Albania)) (INSTAT), indicated a population of 2,402,113, with a notable decline from the 2,821,977 recorded in the 2011 census.[2][297] The decrease in inhabitants began after the disintegration of the communist regime in Albania and is associated with significant shifts within the political, economic, and social structure of Albania.[298][299] A principal factor in this transition incorporates a decline in fertility rates coupled with an increase in emigration, both contributing to persistent demographic changes and challenges.[300] It is forecast that the population will continue shrinking for the next decade at least, depending on the actual rates and the level of migration.[301] Currently, the population density of Albania is measured at 83.6 inhabitants per square kilometer with a varied distribution of inhabitants across different regions.[2][302] The counties of [Tirana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirana_County) and [Durrës](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durr%C3%ABs_County) showcase substantial concentrations of people, accounting for about 41% of the overall demographic of Albania, with 32% residing in Tirana and 9% in Durrës.[303] Conversely, more peripheral and rural counties such as [Gjirokastër](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gjirokast%C3%ABr_County) and [Kukës](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuk%C3%ABs_County) present significantly lower population densities, with each aiding 3% to the overall population.[303]

Historically, the Albanian people have established several communities in many regions throughout Southern Europe. The [Albanian diaspora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_diaspora) has been formed since the late Middle Ages, when they emigrated to escape either various socio-political difficulties or the Ottoman conquest of Albania.[304] Following the fall of communism, large numbers of Albanians have migrated to countries such as Australia, Canada, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. Albanian [minorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_group) are present in the neighbouring territories such as the west of North Macedonia, the southeast of Montenegro, Kosovo in its entirety and parts of southern Serbia. Altogether, the number of ethnic Albanians living abroad is estimated to be higher than the total population inside Albania. As much as a third of those born in the country's borders now live outside of it, making Albania one of the countries with the highest rate of outmigration relative to its population in the world.[305][306] In 2022 the birth rate was 20% lower than in 2021, largely due to emigration of people of childbearing age.[307]


### Urbanisation

Subsequent to the collapse of communism in 1991, Albania has undergone a remarkable transformation in its urban landscape, emerging as one of the fastest urbanising countries in Europe.[308][309][310] At the forefront of this transformation is the [Tirana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirana_County)-[Durrës](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durr%C3%ABs_County) agglomeration, a densely populated urban corridor situated along the [western coast of Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Coastal_Lowlands).[311] This corridor has become the primary locus of population growth and settlement development, attracting a significant influx of internal migrants from the country's peripheral areas.[311] Despite an overall decline of the country's total population, the proportion of the urban demographic has consistently progressed from 47% in 2001 to 65% in 2023.[299][312][313] This sustained increase, coupled with the concentration in the Tirana-Durrës region, has led to a spread of regional imbalances, with the peripheral areas, particularly [Dibër](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dib%C3%ABr_County) and [Kukës](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuk%C3%ABs_County), experiencing severe depopulation.[314][315][303]

### Language

The [official language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_language) of the country is [Albanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_language) which is spoken by the vast majority of the country's population.[327] Its standard spoken and written form is revised and merged from the two main dialects, [Gheg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gheg) and [Tosk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tosk_Albanian), though it is notably based more on the Tosk dialect. The [Shkumbin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shkumbin) river is the rough dividing line between the two dialects. Among minority languages, [Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language) is the second most-spoken language in the country, with 0.5 to 3% of the population speaking it as first language, mainly in the country's south where its speakers are concentrated.[328][329][330][331] Other languages spoken by ethnic minorities in Albania include [Aromanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromanian_language), [Serbian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_language), [Macedonian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonian_language), [Bosnian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnian_language), [Bulgarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_language), [Gorani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gora_dialect), and [Roma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_language).[332] Macedonian is official in the Pustec Municipality in East Albania. According to the 2011 population census, 2,765,610 or 98.8% of the population declared [Albanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_language) as their [mother tongue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_tongue).[333] Because of large migration flows from Albania, over half of Albanians during their life learn a second language. The main foreign language known is English with 40.0%, followed by Italian with 27.8% and Greek with 22.9%. The English speakers were mostly young people, the knowledge of Italian is stable in every age group, while there is a decrease of the speakers of Greek in the youngest group.[334]

Among young people aged 25 or less, English, German and Turkish have seen rising interest after 2000. Italian and French have had a stable interest, while Greek has lost much of its previous interest. The trends are linked with cultural and economic factors.[335]

Young people have shown a growing interest in the [German language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language) in recent years. Some of them go to Germany for studying or various experiences. Albania and Germany have agreements for cooperating in helping young people of the two countries know both cultures better.[336] Due to a sharp rise in economic relations with Turkey, interest in learning Turkish, in particular among young people, has been growing on a yearly basis.[337]


### Minorities

Designated national and cultural minorities in Albania include Aromanian, Greek, Macedonian, Montenegrin, Serb, Roma, Egyptian, Bosnian and Bulgarian peoples, as well as Gorani and Jews as other minority groups.[338][339] The 2023 census recorded the ethnic composition as [Albanians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanians) 2,186,917 (91,04% of the total), [Greeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks_in_Albania) 23,485 (0,98%), [Macedonians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonians_of_Albania) 2,281 (0,09%), [Montenegrins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montenegrins_of_Albania) 511 (0,02%), [Aromanians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromanians_in_Albania) 2,459 (0,1%), [Roma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people_in_Albania) 9,813 (0.4%), [Balkan Egyptians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan_Egyptians) 12,375 (0,5%), [Bosnians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosniaks_in_Albania) 2,963 (0,12%), [Serbians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbs_and_Montenegrins_in_Albania) 584 (0,02%), [Bulgarians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarians_in_Albania) 7,057 (0,29%), mixed ethnicities 770 (0.03%), other ethnicities 3,798 (0.15%), and 134,451 (5.60%) with unspecified ethnicity, out of a total population of 2,402,113.[340]

Contrary to official statistics that show an Albanian majority, the minority groups have frequently disputed the official numbers, asserting a higher percentage of the country's population. The Greek government claimed there were an estimation of 300,000 ethnic Greeks in Albania.[341][342][343][344][345] The [CIA World Factbook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_World_Factbook) estimates the Greek minority to constitute 0.9%[346] of the population. The US State Department estimates that Greeks make up 1.17%, and other minorities 0.23%, of the population.[347] The latter questioned the validity of the 2011 census data about the Greek minority, as measurements had allegedly been affected by boycott.[348]


### Religion

Albania is a [secular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_state) and religiously diverse country with no [official religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_religion). [Freedom of religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion), [belief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_belief) and [conscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_conscience) are guaranteed under the country's [constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Albania).[349] As of the 2023 Census, there were 1,101,718 (45.86%) [Sunni Muslims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni_Islam), 201,530 (8.38%) [Catholics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholicism), 173,645 (7.22%) [Eastern Orthodox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodoxy), 115,644 (4.81%) [Bektashi Muslims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bektashi_Order), 9,658 (0.4%) [Evangelicals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelicalism), 3,670 (0.15%) of other religions, 332,155 (13.82%) believers without denomination, 85,311 (3.55%) Atheists and 378,782 (15.76%) did not provide an answer.[1] Albania is nevertheless ranked among the least religious countries in the world.[350] Religion constitute an important role in the lives of only 39% of the country's population.[351] In another report, 56% considered themselves religious, 30% considered themselves non-religious, while 9% defined themselves as convinced atheists. 80% believed in God.[352]

The [Muslim Albanians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Albania) are spread throughout the country. [Orthodox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodoxy_in_Albania) and [Bektashis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bektashi) are mostly found in the south, whereas [Catholics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholicism_in_Albania) mainly live in the north.[353] In 2008, there were 694 [Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic) churches and 425 [orthodox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church) churches, 568 mosques and 70 [bektashi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bektashi_Order) [takyas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takya) in the country.[354][355]

During [modern times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_history), the Albanian republican, monarchic and later communist regimes followed a systematic policy of separating religion from official functions and cultural life. The country has never had an [official religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_religion) either as a republic or as a kingdom. In the 20th century, the clergy of all faiths was weakened under the monarchy and ultimately eradicated during the 1950s and 1960s, under the state policy of obliterating all organised religion from the territories of Albania. The [communist regime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism_in_Albania) persecuted and suppressed religious observance and institutions and entirely [banned religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-religious). The country was then officially declared to be the world's first [atheist state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheist_state). Religious freedom has returned, however, since the [end of communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_communism_in_Albania).

Islam survived communist era persecution and reemerged in the modern era as a practised religion in Albania.[356] Some smaller Christian sects in Albania include [Evangelicals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelicalism) and several [Protestant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant) communities including [Seventh-day Adventist Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church), [Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints) and [Jehovah's Witnesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah%27s_Witnesses).[357][358][359][360] The first recorded Protestant of Albania was Said Toptani, who travelled around Europe and returned to [Tirana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirana) in 1853, where he preached [Protestantism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism). The first [evangelical Protestants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelical_Protestants) appeared in the 19th century and the Evangelical Alliance was founded in 1892. Nowadays, it has 160 member congregations from different Protestant denominations. Following mass emigration to Israel after the fall of communism, there are only 200 Albanian [Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism_in_Albania) left in the country.[361][362]


## Culture


### Symbols

The red and black [national colours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_colours) are displayed on the [flag of Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Albania) that is adorned with a [double-headed eagle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-headed_eagle) as the foremost recognised [national symbol of Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_symbols_of_Albania).[363][364][365] With the black eagle portraying bravery and strength, the red field symbolises the fortitude and sacrifices of the Albanian people.[363] The eagle is linked with the legacy of the national hero [Gjergj Kastrioti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skanderbeg), renowned as Skanderbeg, who led a prosperous [resistance movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skanderbeg%27s_rebellion) against Ottoman rule.[366][367][365] Rooted in the Middle Ages, it emerged as a [heraldic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_heraldry) [symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armorial_of_Albania) in the [Principality of Arbër](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Arbanon) and among notable Albanian dynasties such as the [Dukagjini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukagjini_family), [Kastrioti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kastrioti_family), [Muzaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muzaka_family) and [Thopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thopia_family) clans.[368] Amid the [Albanian Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_National_Awakening), marking the resurgence of Albanian national identity and aspirations for independence, the Albanian eagle regained its prominence.[364] Its importance reached its culmination with [Albania's declaration of independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Declaration_of_Independence) in 1912, when [Ismail Qemali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Qemali) raised it as the national flag in [Vlorë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlor%C3%AB).[364]

The [coat of arms of Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_Albania) is an adaptation of the flag of Albania and the seal of Skanderbeg.[363] The coat comprises the black double-headed eagle positioned at the centre of a red field.[363] Above the eagle, it carries the [helmet of Skanderbeg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_of_Skanderbeg) that is crowned with the head of a golden horned goat.[365] [Ti Shqipëri, më jep nder, më jep emrin Shqipëtar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ti_Shqip%C3%ABri,_m%C3%AB_jep_nder,_m%C3%AB_jep_emrin_Shqip%C3%ABtar), which translates to "You Albania, give me honour, give me the name Albanian", is the [national motto of Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_mottos).[364][365] It finds its foundation in the legacy of [national poet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_poet) [Naim Frashëri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naim_Frash%C3%ABri), who held a renowned role during the Albanian Renaissance.[364] The [national anthem of Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_anthem), "[Himni i Flamurit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himni_i_Flamurit)", was composed by [Asdreni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksand%C3%ABr_Stavre_Drenova) and adopted as such following Albania's independence in 1912.[363]

[Albanian traditional clothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_national_clothing), with its contrasting variations for the northern [Gheg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghegs) and southern [Tosk Albanians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tosks), is a testament to Albania's history, cultural diversity and ethnic identity.[369] Gheg men wear a light-colored shirt paired with wide loose-fitting trousers referred to as the Tirq. These trousers are securely fastened by a wide woven belt, the Brez. An integral component of their costume is the [Xhamadan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xhamadan), a woolen red velvet vest adorned with folkloric motifs and gold patterns.[370] They also wear a distinctive dome-shaped hat known as the [Qeleshe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qeleshe), crafted from wool, with its origins tracing back to the [Illyrians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illyrians).[371][372] Conversely, Tosk men opt for the [Fustanella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fustanella), a knee-length garment designated as the national costume, typically white with pleats, accompanied by a white shirt. They also wear a beige or dark blue Xhamadan reminiscent of the Gheg attire. To complete their attire, men wear knee-high socks referred to as [Çorape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87orape) and leather shoes known as [Opinga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinga).

The attire of Gheg and Tosk women is renowned for its rich palette of colors and intricate filigree detailing, displayed across various components including ear ornaments, finger rings, necklaces, belt buckles and buttons. Key components include a long, light-toned shirt paired with an apron, often accompanied by a woolen or felt mantle referred to as the Xhoka. Additional upper garments, such as the Dollama or Mintan, may be layered, along with a headscarf known as Kapica or Shall. A distinctive variation incorporates a pair of aprons, including the Pështjellak at the rear and the Paranik at the front. Integral to the traditional attire of Gheg women is the ancient [Xhubleta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xhubleta).[369] Dedicated efforts have been undertaken to preserve and promote the dress, acknowledging its significance as an emblem of Albanian heritage.[373] As a testament to its importance, the Xhubleta has been inscribed on the [UNESCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO) [Intangible Cultural Heritage List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO_Intangible_Cultural_Heritage_Lists).[373] The distinctive bell-shaped garment is fashioned in black and enriched with embroidered ethnic Albanian motifs, showcasing the remarkable craftsmanship of northern Albania.[369] Its crafting process involves multiple intricate stages, encompassing the preparation of shajak fabric and the precise cutting techniques.[373]


### Art and architecture

The [artistic history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_art) of Albania has been particularly influenced by a multitude of ancient and medieval [people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilisation), traditions and religions. It covers a broad spectrum with mediums and disciplines that include painting, [pottery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pottery), sculpture, [ceramics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramic) and architecture all of them exemplifying a great variety in style and shape, in different regions and period.

The rise of the [Byzantine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire) and [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire) in the [Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages) was accompanied by a corresponding growth in [Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_art) and [Islamic art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_art) in the lands of Albania which are apparent in examples of architecture and mosaics throughout the country.[374] Centuries later, the [Albanian Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Renaissance) proved crucial to the emancipation of the modern Albanian culture and saw unprecedented developments in all fields of literature and art whereas artists sought to return to the ideals of [Impressionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressionism) and [Romanticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism_(art)).[375] However, [Onufri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onufri), [Kolë Idromeno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kol%C3%AB_Idromeno), [David Selenica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Selenica), [Kostandin Shpataraku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kostandin_Shpataraku) and the [Zografi Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zografi_Brothers) are the most eminent representatives of Albanian art.

The [architecture of Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_Albania) reflects the legacy of various civilisations tracing back to the [classical antiquity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity). Major cities in Albania have evolved from within the castle to include dwellings, religious and commercial structures, with constant redesigning of town squares and evolution of building techniques. Nowadays, the cities and towns reflect a whole spectrum of various [architectural styles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_style). In the 20th century, many historical as well as [sacred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_architecture) buildings bearing the ancient influence were demolished during the [communist era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism_in_Albania).[376]

[Ancient architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_architecture) is found throughout Albania and most visible in [Byllis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byllis), [Amantia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amantia), [Phoenice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenice), [Apollonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonia_(Illyria)), [Butrint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butrint), [Antigonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigonia_(Chaonia)), [Shkodër](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rozafa_Castle) and [Durrës](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durr%C3%ABs_Amphitheatre). Considering the long period of rule of the [Byzantine Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire), they introduced castles, citadels, churches and monasteries with spectacular wealth of visible [murals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mural) and [frescos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresco). Perhaps the best known examples can be found in the southern Albanian cities and surroundings of [Korçë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kor%C3%A7%C3%AB), [Berat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berat), [Voskopojë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voskopoj%C3%AB) and [Gjirokastër](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gjirokast%C3%ABr). Involving the introduction of [Ottoman architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_architecture) there was a development of mosques and other Islamic buildings, particularly seen in Berat and Gjirokastër.

A productive period of [Historicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicism_(art)), [Art Nouveau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Nouveau) and [Neoclassicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassicism) merged into the 19th century, best exemplified in [Korçë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kor%C3%A7%C3%AB). The 20th century brought new architectural styles such as the modern [Italian style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italianate_architecture), which is present in [Tirana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tirana) such as the [Skanderbeg Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skanderbeg_Square) and Ministries. It is also present in Shkodër, [Vlorë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlor%C3%AB), [Sarandë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarand%C3%AB) and [Durrës](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durr%C3%ABs). Moreover, other towns received their present-day Albania-unique appearance through various cultural or economic influences.

[Socialist classicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_classicism) arrived during the [communist era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peoples_Republic_of_Albania) in Albania after the [Second World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War). At this period many socialist-styled complexes, wide roads and factories were constructed, while town squares were redesigned and numerous of historic and important buildings demolished. Notable examples of that style include the [Mother Teresa Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Teresa_Square_(Tirana)), [Pyramid of Tirana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_of_Tirana), [Palace of Congresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Congresses) and so on.

Three Albanian [archaeological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology) sites are included in the list of [UNESCO World Heritage Sites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO_World_Heritage_Site). These include the ancient remains of Butrint, the medieval [Historic Centres of Berat and Gjirokastër](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historic_Centres_of_Berat_and_Gjirokast%C3%ABr), and [Natural and Cultural Heritage of the Ohrid region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohrid_Lake) site shared with [North Macedonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Macedonia) since 2019.[377][378] Furthermore, the royal [Illyrian tombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Tombs_of_Selca_e_Poshtme), the remains of [Apollonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonia_(Illyria)), the ancient [Amphitheatre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durr%C3%ABs_Amphitheatre) of Durrës and the [Fortress of Bashtovë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortress_of_Bashtov%C3%AB) has been included on the tentative list of Albania.


### Cuisine

Throughout the centuries, [Albanian cuisine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_cuisine) has been widely influenced by [Albanian culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_culture), [geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_Albania) and [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Albania), and as such, different parts of the country enjoy specific [regional cuisines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_cuisine). Cooking traditions especially vary between the north and the south, owing to differing [topography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography) and [climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate) that essentially contribute to the excellent growth conditions for a wide array of herbs, fruits, and vegetables.[379]

Albanians produce and use many varieties of fruits such as [lemons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_(fruit)), oranges, [figs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figs_(fruit)), and most notably, [olives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_(fruit)), which are perhaps the most important element of Albanian cooking. Spices and other herbs such as [basil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_(herb)), [lavender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavender), [mint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearmint), [oregano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregano), [rosemary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosemary), and [thyme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyme) are widely used, as are vegetables such as garlic, onions, [peppers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_pepper), potatoes, tomatoes, as well as [legumes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legume) of all types.

With a coastline along the [Adriatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Adriatic_Sea_Coast) and [Ionian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Ionian_Sea_Coast) in the [Mediterranean Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea), fish, [crustaceans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean), and seafood are a popular and an integral part of the Albanian diet. Otherwise, [lamb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamb_(food)) is the traditional meat for different holidays and [religious festivals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_festival) for both [Christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_in_Albania) and [Muslims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Albania), although poultry, beef, and pork are also in plentiful supply.

[Tavë kosi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tav%C3%AB_kosi) ("[soured milk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soured_milk) [casserole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casserole)") is the [national dish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_dish) of Albania, consisting of lamb and rice baked under a thick, tart veil of [yoghurt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoghurt). [Fërgesë](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%ABrges%C3%AB) is another national dish, made up of peppers, tomatoes, and [cottage cheese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cottage_cheese). Pite is also popular, a baked pastry with a filling of a mixture of [spinach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinach) and gjizë (curd) or mish ([ground meat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_meat)).

Petulla, a traditional fried dough, is also a popular speciality, and is served with [powdered sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powdered_sugar) or [feta cheese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feta_cheese) and different sorts of [fruit jams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_preserves). [Flia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flia) consists of multiple [crêpe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr%C3%AApe)-like layers brushed with cream and served with sour cream. [Krofne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krofne), similar to [Berliner doughnuts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berliner_(doughnut)), are filled with jam, or chocolate and often eaten during winter.

Coffee is an integral part of the Albanian lifestyle. The country has more coffee houses per capita than any other country in the world.[380] Tea is also enjoyed both at home or outside at cafés, bars, or restaurants. Çaj Mali ([Sideritis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sideritis) tea) is enormously beloved, and a part of the daily routine for most Albanians. It is cultivated across Southern Albania and noted for its medicinal properties. [Black tea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_tea) is also popular.

[Albanian wine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_wine) is also common throughout the country, and has been cultivated for thousands of years. Albania has a long and ancient history of wine production, and belongs to the [Old World of wine producing countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_World_wine).[381][382]


### Music

Albanian folk music is a prominent part of the national identity, and continues to play a major part in overall [Albanian music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Albania). Folk music can be divided into two stylistic groups, mainly the northern [Gheg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gheg_Albanian) varieties, and southern [Lab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab%C3%ABria) and [Tosk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tosk_Albanian) varieties. Northern and southern traditions are contrasted by a rugged tone from the north, and the more relaxed southern form of music.

Many songs concern events from [Albanian history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Albania) and [culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Albania), including traditional themes of honour, hospitality, treachery, and revenge. The first compilation of Albanian folk music was made by two [Himariot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himara) musicians, [Neço Muka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ne%C3%A7o_Muko) and Koço Çakali, in Paris, during their work with Albanian soprano [Tefta Tashko-Koço](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tefta_Tashko-Ko%C3%A7o). Several [gramophone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonograph_record) compilations were recorded at the time by the three artists, which eventually led to the recognition of [Albanian iso-polyphony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_iso-polyphony) as a [UNESCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO) [Intangible Cultural Heritage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO_Intangible_Cultural_Heritage_Lists).[384]

[Festivali i Këngës](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festivali_i_K%C3%ABng%C3%ABs) is a traditional Albanian song contest organised by the national broadcaster [Radio Televizioni Shqiptar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Televizioni_Shqiptar) (RTSH). The festival is celebrated annually since its inauguration in 1962 and has launched the careers of some of Albania's most successful singers including [Vaçe Zela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Va%C3%A7e_Zela) and [Parashqevi Simaku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parashqevi_Simaku).[385] It is significantly a music competition among Albanian performers presenting unreleased songs in premiere, composed by Albanian authors and voted by juries or by public.

Contemporary artists [Rita Ora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rita_Ora), [Bebe Rexha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bebe_Rexha), [Era Istrefi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Era_Istrefi), [Dua Lipa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dua_Lipa), [Ava Max](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ava_Max), [Bleona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleona), [Elvana Gjata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvana_Gjata), [Ermonela Jaho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ermonela_Jaho), and [Inva Mula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inva_Mula) have achieved international recognition for their music,[386] while soprano [Ermonela Jaho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ermonela_Jaho) has been described by some as the "world's most acclaimed soprano".[387] Albanian opera singer [Saimir Pirgu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saimir_Pirgu) was nominated for the 2017 [Grammy Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award).[388]


### Literature

The cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the development of the [Albanian language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_language) in the area of church texts and publications. The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition, when cleric [Gjon Buzuku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gjon_Buzuku) translated the [Catholic liturgy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_liturgy) into Albanian, trying to do for Albanian what [Martin Luther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther) had done for German. [Meshari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meshari) (The Missal) written by [Gjon Buzuku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gjon_Buzuku) was published in 1555 and is considered one of the first literary work of written Albanian during the Middle Ages. The refined level of the language and the stabilised orthography must be the result of an earlier tradition of written Albanian, a tradition that is not well understood. However, there is some fragmented evidence, pre-dating Buzuku, which indicates that Albanian was written from at least the 14th century.

Albanian writings from these centuries must not have been religious texts only, but historical chronicles too. They are mentioned by the humanist [Marin Barleti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marin_Barleti), who in his book [Siege of Shkodër](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Shkodra_(1478)#The_Book) (Rrethimi i Shkodrës) from 1504, confirms that he leafed through such chronicles written in the language of the people (in vernacula lingua) as well as his famous biography of [Skanderbeg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skanderbeg) [Historia de vita et gestis Scanderbegi Epirotarum principis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marin_Barleti) (History of Skanderbeg) from 1508. The History of Skanderbeg is still the foundation of Skanderbeg studies and is considered an Albanian cultural treasure, vital to the formation of Albanian national self-consciousness.

During the 16th and the 17th centuries, the [catechism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catechism) (E mbësuame krishterë) (Christian Teachings) from 1592 written by [Lekë Matrënga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lek%C3%AB_Matr%C3%ABnga), (Doktrina e krishterë) (The Christian Doctrine) from 1618 and (Rituale romanum) 1621 by [Pjetër Budi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pjet%C3%ABr_Budi), the first writer of original Albanian [prose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prose) and poetry, an [apology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remorse) for George Castriot (1636) by [Frang Bardhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frang_Bardhi), who also published a dictionary and [folklore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklore) creations, the theological-philosophical treaty [Cuneus Prophetarum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneus_Prophetarum) (The Band of Prophets) (1685) by [Pjetër Bogdani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pjet%C3%ABr_Bogdani), the most universal personality of Albanian [Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages), were published in [Albanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_language). The most famous Albanian writer in the 20th and 21st century is probably [Ismail Kadare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Kadare).


### Sports

Albania participated at the [Olympic Games in 1972](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1972_Summer_Olympics) for the first time. The country made their Winter Olympic Games debut in [2006](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Olympics_2006). Albania missed the next four games, two of them due to the 1980 and 1984 boycotts, but returned for the 1992 games in [Barcelona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Olympic_Winter_Games). Since then, Albania have participated in all games. Albania normally competes in events that include swimming, athletics, weightlifting, shooting and wrestling. The country have been represented by the [National Olympic Committee of Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Olympic_Committee_of_Albania) since 1972. The nation has participated at the [Mediterranean Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Games) since the games of [1987](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1987_Mediterranean_Games) in Syria. The Albanian athletes have won a total of 43 (8 gold, 17 silver and 18 bronze) medals from [1987](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1987_Mediterranean_Games) to [2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Mediterranean_Games).

Popular sports in Albania include [football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_Albania), weightlifting, [basketball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania_national_basketball_team), volleyball, tennis, swimming, [rugby union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union) and gymnastics. Football is by far the most popular sport in Albania. It is governed by the [Football Association of Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Association_of_Albania) ([Albanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_language): Federata Shqiptare e Futbollit, F.SH.F.), which has membership in [FIFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA) and [UEFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA).

The [Albania national football team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania_national_football_team), ranking 51st in the [World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Rankings) in 2017 (highest 22nd on 22 August 2015) have won the [1946 Balkan Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1946_Balkan_Cup) and the [Malta Rothmans International Tournament 2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothmans_International_Tournament_2000), but had never participated in any major [UEFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA) or [FIFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA) tournament, until [UEFA Euro 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2016), Albania's first ever appearance at the continental tournament and at a major men's football tournament. Albania scored their first ever goal in a major tournament and secured their first ever win in European Championship when they beat [Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania_national_football_team) by 1–0 in a [UEFA Euro 2016](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2016) match on 19 June 2016.[389][390] The most successful football clubs are [Skënderbeu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KF_Sk%C3%ABnderbeu_Kor%C3%A7%C3%AB), [KF Tirana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KF_Tirana), [Dinamo Tirana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FK_Dinamo_Tirana), [Partizani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FK_Partizani_Tirana) and [Vllaznia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KF_Vllaznia_Shkod%C3%ABr).

Weightlifting is one of the most successful individual sport for the Albanians, with the national team winning medals at the [European Weightlifting Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Weightlifting_Championships) and the rest international competitions. Albanian weightlifters have won a total of 16 medals at the [European Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Weightlifting_Championships) with 1 of them being gold, 7 silver and 8 bronze. In the [World Weightlifting Championships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Weightlifting_Championships), the Albanian weightlifting team has won in [1972](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1972_World_Weightlifting_Championships) a gold in [2002](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_World_Weightlifting_Championships) a silver and in [2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_World_Weightlifting_Championships) a bronze medal.


## Human rights

Nearly 60% of women in rural areas suffer physical or psychological violence and nearly 8% are victims of sexual violence. Protection orders are often violated. In 2014 the Albanian Helsinki Committee (AHC) reported that the number of female murder victims is still high.[391] The Commissioner for Protection from Discrimination has raised concerns regarding the family registration law that discriminates against women. As a result, heads of households, who are overwhelmingly men, have the right to change family residency without their partners' permission.[391]

In 2015, the association [ILGA-Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILGA-Europe) ranked Albania 19th in terms of LGBT rights out of 49 observed European countries.[392] Meanwhile, on the latest report in 2022, lack of progress caused Albania to be ranked the 28th country in Europe, among 49 countries observed.[393]
