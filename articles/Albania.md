is a country in [Southeast
Europe](Southeast_Europe "Southeast Europe"){.wikilink}. It is located
in the [Balkans](Balkans "Balkans"){.wikilink}, on the
[Adriatic](Adriatic_Sea "Adriatic"){.wikilink} and [Ionian
Seas](Ionian_Sea "Ionian Sea"){.wikilink} within the [Mediterranean
Sea](Mediterranean_Sea "Mediterranean Sea"){.wikilink}, and shares [land
borders](land_border "land border"){.wikilink} with
[Montenegro](Montenegro "Montenegro"){.wikilink} to the northwest,
[Kosovo](Kosovo "Kosovo"){.wikilink} to the northeast, [North
Macedonia](North_Macedonia "North Macedonia"){.wikilink} to the east and
[Greece](Greece "Greece"){.wikilink} to the south. With an area of
`{{Convert|28748|sqkm|abbr=on}}`{=mediawiki}, it has a varied range of
climatic, geological, hydrological and morphological conditions.
Albania\'s landscapes range from rugged snow-capped mountains in the
[Albanian Alps](Accursed_Mountains "Albanian Alps"){.wikilink} and the
[Korab](Korab "Korab"){.wikilink},
[Skanderbeg](Central_Mountain_Range,_Albania#Skanderbeg_Mountains "Skanderbeg"){.wikilink},
[Pindus](Pindus "Pindus"){.wikilink} and [Ceraunian
Mountains](Ceraunian_Mountains "Ceraunian Mountains"){.wikilink}, to
fertile lowland plains extending from the
[Adriatic](Albanian_Adriatic_Sea_Coast "Adriatic"){.wikilink} and
[Ionian](Albanian_Ionian_Sea_Coast "Ionian"){.wikilink} seacoasts.
[Tirana](Tirana "Tirana"){.wikilink} is the capital and largest city in
the country, followed by [Durrës](Durrës "Durrës"){.wikilink},
[Vlorë](Vlorë "Vlorë"){.wikilink}, and
[Shkodër](Shkodër "Shkodër"){.wikilink}.

In ancient times, the [Illyrians](Illyrians "Illyrians"){.wikilink}
inhabited northern and central regions of Albania, whilst
[Epirotes](Epirotes "Epirotes"){.wikilink} inhabited the south. Several
important ancient [Greek
colonies](Greek_colonisation "Greek colonies"){.wikilink} were also
established on the coast. The [Illyrian
kingdom](Illyrian_kingdom "Illyrian kingdom"){.wikilink} centred in what
is now Albania was the dominant power before the [rise of
Macedon](rise_of_Macedon "rise of Macedon"){.wikilink}.[^1] In the 2nd
century BC, the [Roman
Republic](Roman_Republic "Roman Republic"){.wikilink} annexed the
region, and after the division of the [Roman
Empire](Roman_Empire "Roman Empire"){.wikilink} it became part of
[Byzantium](Byzantine_Empire "Byzantium"){.wikilink}. The first known
[Albanian](Albanians "Albanian"){.wikilink} autonomous principality,
[Arbanon](Arbanon "Arbanon"){.wikilink}, was established in the 12th
century. The [Kingdom of
Albania](Kingdom_of_Albania_(medieval) "Kingdom of Albania"){.wikilink},
[Principality of
Albania](Principality_of_Albania_(medieval) "Principality of Albania"){.wikilink}
and [Albania Veneta](Albania_Veneta "Albania Veneta"){.wikilink} were
formed between the 13th and 15th centuries in different parts of the
country, alongside other Albanian principalities and political entities.
In the late 15th century, Albania [became
part](Ottoman_Albania "became part"){.wikilink} of the [Ottoman
Empire](Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire"){.wikilink}. In 1912, the modern
Albanian state [declared
independence](Declaration_of_independence_of_Albania "declared independence"){.wikilink}.
In 1939, [Italy](Kingdom_of_Italy "Italy"){.wikilink} invaded the
[Kingdom of
Albania](Kingdom_of_Albania_(1928–39) "Kingdom of Albania"){.wikilink},
which became [Greater
Albania](Albanian_Kingdom_(1939–43) "Greater Albania"){.wikilink}, and
then a
[protectorate](Albanian_Kingdom_(1943–44) "protectorate"){.wikilink} of
[Nazi Germany](Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany"){.wikilink} during [World War
II](World_War_II "World War II"){.wikilink}.[^2] After the war, the
[People\'s Socialist Republic of
Albania](People's_Socialist_Republic_of_Albania "People's Socialist Republic of Albania"){.wikilink}
was formed, which lasted until the [Revolutions of
1991](Revolutions_of_1989 "Revolutions of 1991"){.wikilink} concluded
with the [fall of communism in
Albania](fall_of_communism_in_Albania "fall of communism in Albania"){.wikilink}
and eventually the establishment of the current Republic of Albania.

Since its independence in 1912, Albania has undergone a diverse
political evolution, transitioning from a
[monarchy](monarchy "monarchy"){.wikilink} to a [communist
regime](Communism "communist regime"){.wikilink} before becoming a
[sovereign](sovereign_state "sovereign"){.wikilink}
[parliamentary](parliamentary_republic "parliamentary"){.wikilink}
[constitutional
republic](constitutional_republic "constitutional republic"){.wikilink}.
Governed by a
[constitution](Constitution_of_Albania "constitution"){.wikilink}
prioritising the separation of powers, the country\'s political
structure includes a
[parliament](Parliament_of_Albania "parliament"){.wikilink}, a
ceremonial [president](President_of_Albania "president"){.wikilink}, a
functional [prime
minister](Prime_Minister_of_Albania "prime minister"){.wikilink} and a
hierarchy of courts. Albania is a [developing
country](developing_country "developing country"){.wikilink} with an
[upper-middle
income](List_of_countries_by_GNI_(nominal,_Atlas_method)_per_capita#Upper-middle-income_group "upper-middle income"){.wikilink}
[economy](Economy_of_Albania "economy"){.wikilink} driven by the service
sector, with manufacturing and
[tourism](Tourism_in_Albania "tourism"){.wikilink} also playing
significant roles.[^3] After the dissolution of its communist system the
country shifted from [centralised
planning](Planned_economy "centralised planning"){.wikilink} to an
[open](Open_market "open"){.wikilink} [market
economy](market_economy "market economy"){.wikilink}.[^4] Albanian
citizens have [universal health
care](universal_health_care "universal health care"){.wikilink} access
and free primary and secondary education. The country is an official
candidate for membership in the European Union.

## Etymology

```{=mediawiki}
{{main|Names of the Albanians and Albania}}
```
The historical origins of the term \"Albania\" can be traced back to
[medieval Latin](medieval_Latin "medieval Latin"){.wikilink}, with its
foundations believed to be associated with the [Illyrian
tribe](Illyrian_tribe "Illyrian tribe"){.wikilink} of the
[Albani](Albani_(Illyrian_tribe) "Albani"){.wikilink}. This connection
gains further support from the work of the Ancient Greek geographer
[Ptolemy](Ptolemy "Ptolemy"){.wikilink} during the 2nd century AD, where
he included the settlement of
[Albanopolis](Albanopolis "Albanopolis"){.wikilink} situated to the
northeast of [Durrës](Durrës "Durrës"){.wikilink}.[^5][^6] The presence
of a medieval settlement named
[Albanon](Principality_of_Arbanon "Albanon"){.wikilink} or Arbanon hints
at the possibility of historical continuity. The precise relationship
among these historical references and the question of whether
Albanopolis was synonymous with Albanon remain subjects of scholarly
debate.[^7]

The Byzantine historian [Michael
Attaliates](Michael_Attaliates "Michael Attaliates"){.wikilink}, in his
11th-century historical account, provides the earliest undisputed
reference to the Albanians, when he mentions them having taken part in a
revolt against
[Constantinople](Constantinople "Constantinople"){.wikilink} in
1079.[^8] He also identifies the Arbanitai as subjects of the Duke of
[Dyrrachium](Durrës "Dyrrachium"){.wikilink}.[^9] In the Middle Ages,
Albania was denoted as `{{lang|sq|Arbëri|i=yes}}`{=mediawiki} or
`{{lang|sq|Arbëni|i=yes}}`{=mediawiki} by its inhabitants, who
identified themselves as `{{lang|sq|Arbëreshë|i=yes}}`{=mediawiki} or
`{{lang|sq|Arbëneshë|i=yes}}`{=mediawiki}.[^10] Albanians employ the
terms `{{lang|sq|Shqipëri|i=yes}}`{=mediawiki} or
`{{lang|sq|Shqipëria|i=yes}}`{=mediawiki} for their nation, designations
that trace their historical origins to the 14th century.[^11] But only
in the late 17th and early 18th centuries did these terms gradually
supersede `{{lang|sq|Arbëria|i=yes}}`{=mediawiki} and
`{{lang|sq|Arbëreshë|i=yes}}`{=mediawiki} among Albanians.[^12][^13]
These two expressions are widely interpreted to symbolise \"Children of
the Eagles\" and \"Land of the Eagles\".[^14][^15]

![The remains of the [Kamenica
Tumulus](Kamenica_Tumulus "Kamenica Tumulus"){.wikilink} in the [county

Korçë](county_of_Korçë "county of Korçë"){.wikilink}](Kamenicë_Tumulus,_Albania_2018_02.jpg "The remains of the Kamenica Tumulus in the county of Korçë")

Mesolithic habitation in Albania has been evidenced in several open air
sites which during that period were close to the Adriatic coastline and
in cave sites. Mesolithic objects found in a cave near Xarrë include
[flint](flint "flint"){.wikilink} and
[jasper](jasper "jasper"){.wikilink} objects along with fossilised
animal bones, while those discoveries at Mount Dajt comprise bone and
stone tools similar to those of the [Aurignacian
culture](Aurignacian_culture "Aurignacian culture"){.wikilink}.[^16] The
[Neolithic](Neolithic "Neolithic"){.wikilink} era in Albania began
around 7000 BC and is evidenced in finds which indicate domestication of
sheep and goats and small-scale agriculture. A part of the Neolithic
population may have been the same as the Mesolithic population of the
southern Balkans like in the [Konispol](Konispol "Konispol"){.wikilink}
cave where the Mesolithic stratum co-exists with Pre-Pottery Neolithic
finds. [Cardium pottery](Cardium_pottery "Cardium pottery"){.wikilink}
culture appears in coastal Albania and across the Adriatic after 6500
BC, while the settlements of the interior took part in the processes
which formed the [Starčevo
culture](Starčevo_culture "Starčevo culture"){.wikilink}.[^17] The
Albanian [bitumen](bitumen "bitumen"){.wikilink} mines of
[Selenicë](Selenicë "Selenicë"){.wikilink} provide early evidence of
bitumen exploitation in Europe, dating to Late Neolithic Albania (from
5000 BC), when local communities used it as pigment for ceramic
decoration, [waterproofing](waterproofing "waterproofing"){.wikilink},
and [adhesive](adhesive "adhesive"){.wikilink} for reparing broken
vessels. The bitumen of Selenicë circulated towards eastern Albania from
the early 5th millennium BC. First evidence of its overseas trade export
comes from Neolithic and Bronze Age southern
[Italy](Italy "Italy"){.wikilink}. The high-quality bitumen of Selenicë
has been exploited throughout all the historical ages since the Late
Neolithic era until today.[^18]

The
[Indo-Europeanisation](Indo-European_migrations "Indo-Europeanisation"){.wikilink}
of Albania in the context of the IE-isation of the western Balkans began
after 2800 BC. The presence of the Early Bronze Age
[tumuli](Tumulus "tumuli"){.wikilink} in the vicinity of later
[Apollonia](Apollonia_(Illyria) "Apollonia"){.wikilink} dates to
2679±174 calBC (2852-2505 calBC). These burial mounds belong to the
southern expression of the Adriatic-Ljubljana culture (related to later
[Cetina culture](Cetina_culture "Cetina culture"){.wikilink}) which
moved southwards along the Adriatic from the northern Balkans. The same
community built similar mounds in Montenegro (Rakića Kuće) and northern
Albania (Shtoj).[^19] The first
[archaeogenetic](Archaeogenetics "archaeogenetic"){.wikilink} find
related to the IE-isation of Albania involves a man with predominantly
[Yamnaya ancestry](Western_Steppe_Herders "Yamnaya ancestry"){.wikilink}
buried in a tumulus of northeastern Albania which dates to 2663--2472
calBC.[^20] During the Middle Bronze Age, Cetina culture sites and finds
appear in Albania. Cetina culture moved southwards across the Adriatic
from the [Cetina valley](Cetina "Cetina valley"){.wikilink} of
[Dalmatia](Dalmatia "Dalmatia"){.wikilink}. In Albania, Cetina finds are
concentrated around southern [Lake
Shkodër](Lake_Shkodër "Lake Shkodër"){.wikilink} and appear typically in
tumulus cemeteries like in Shkrel and Shtoj and hillforts like Gajtan
(Shkodër) as well as cave sites like Blaz, Nezir and Keputa (central
Albania) and lake basin sites like Sovjan (southeastern Albania).[^21]

![Founded in the 4th century BC, the city of
[Scodra](Scodra "Scodra"){.wikilink} was the capital of the [Illyrian
kingdom](Illyrian_kingdom "Illyrian kingdom"){.wikilink} of
[Ardiaei](Ardiaei "Ardiaei"){.wikilink} and

The incorporated territory of Albania was historically inhabited by
[Indo-European
peoples](Indo-European_people "Indo-European people"){.wikilink},
amongst them numerous [Illyrian](Illyrian_tribes "Illyrian"){.wikilink}
and [Epirote](Epirus_(ancient_state) "Epirote"){.wikilink} tribes. There
were also several [Greek
colonies](Greek_colonization "Greek colonies"){.wikilink}. The territory
referred to as [Illyria](Illyria "Illyria"){.wikilink} corresponded
roughly to the area east of the [Adriatic
Sea](Adriatic_Sea "Adriatic Sea"){.wikilink} in the [Mediterranean

The first account of the Illyrian groups comes from [Periplus of the
Euxine
Sea](Periplus_of_the_Euxine_Sea "Periplus of the Euxine Sea"){.wikilink},
a Greek text written in the 4th century BC.[^24] The
[Bryges](Bryges "Bryges"){.wikilink} were also present in central
Albania, while the south was inhabited by the Epirote
[Chaonians](Chaonians "Chaonians"){.wikilink}, whose capital was at
[Phoenice](Phoenice "Phoenice"){.wikilink}.[^25][^26][^27] Other
colonies such as [Apollonia](Apollonia_(Illyria) "Apollonia"){.wikilink}
and [Epidamnos](Epidamnos "Epidamnos"){.wikilink} were established by
Greek city-states on the coast by the 7th century BC.[^28][^29][^30]

![[Apollonia](Apollonia_(Illyria) "Apollonia"){.wikilink} was an
important [Greek
colony](Colonies_in_antiquity#Greek_colonies "Greek colony"){.wikilink}

[Adriatic Sea](Adriatic_Sea "Adriatic Sea"){.wikilink} and one of the
western points of the [Via
Egnatia](Via_Egnatia "Via Egnatia"){.wikilink} route, that connected
Rome and
[Constantinople](Constantinople "Constantinople"){.wikilink}](Parku_Arkeologjik_i_Apollonisë_04.jpg "Apollonia was an important Greek colony on the Illyrian coast along the Adriatic Sea and one of the western points of the Via Egnatia route, that connected Rome and Constantinople")

The Illyrian [Taulanti](Taulantii "Taulanti"){.wikilink} were a powerful
Illyrian tribe that were among the earliest recorded tribes in the area.
They lived in an area that corresponds much of present-day Albania.
Together with the Dardanian ruler
[Cleitus](Cleitus_(son_of_Bardylis) "Cleitus"){.wikilink},
[Glaucias](Glaucias_of_Taulantii "Glaucias"){.wikilink}, the ruler of
the Taulantian kingdom, fought against [Alexander the
Great](Alexander_the_Great "Alexander the Great"){.wikilink} at the
[Battle of Pelium](Siege_of_Pelium "Battle of Pelium"){.wikilink} in 335
BC. As the time passed, the ruler of Ancient Macedonia, [Cassander of
Macedon](Cassander "Cassander of Macedon"){.wikilink} captured Apollonia
and crossed the river [Genusus](Shkumbin "Genusus"){.wikilink}
(`{{Langx|sq|Shkumbin}}`{=mediawiki}) in 314 BC. A few years later
Glaucias laid siege to Apollonia and captured the Greek colony of
[Epidamnos](Epidamnos "Epidamnos"){.wikilink}.[^31]

The Illyrian [Ardiaei](Ardiaei "Ardiaei"){.wikilink} tribe, centred in
Montenegro, ruled over most of the territory of northern Albania. Their
[Ardiaean Kingdom](Ardiaean_Kingdom "Ardiaean Kingdom"){.wikilink}
reached its greatest extent under [King
Agron](Agron_of_Illyria "King Agron"){.wikilink}, the son of [Pleuratus
II](Pleuratus_II "Pleuratus II"){.wikilink}. Agron extended his rule
over other neighbouring tribes as well.[^32] Following Agron\'s death in
230 BC, his wife, [Teuta](Teuta "Teuta"){.wikilink}, inherited
the Ardiaean kingdom. Teuta\'s forces extended their operations further
southwards to the Ionian Sea.[^33] In 229 BC, Rome declared war[^34] on
the kingdom for extensively plundering Roman ships. The war ended in
Illyrian defeat in 227 BC. Teuta was eventually succeeded
by [Gentius](Gentius "Gentius"){.wikilink} in 181 BC.[^35] Gentius
clashed with the Romans in 168 BC, initiating the [Third Illyrian
War](Third_Illyrian_War "Third Illyrian War"){.wikilink}. The conflict
resulted in Roman conquest of the region by 167 BC. The Romans split the
region into three administrative divisions.[^36]

### Middle Ages {#middle_ages}

![The town of [Krujë](Krujë "Krujë"){.wikilink} was the capital of the
[Principality of
Arbanon](Principality_of_Arbanon "Principality of Arbanon"){.wikilink}
in the Middle
Ages](Krujë-KrujaAlbania_2016.jpg "The town of Krujë was the capital of the Principality of Arbanon in the Middle Ages")

The [Roman Empire](Roman_Empire "Roman Empire"){.wikilink} was split in
395 upon the death of [Theodosius
I](Theodosius_I "Theodosius I"){.wikilink} into an
[Eastern](Eastern_Roman_Empire "Eastern"){.wikilink} and [Western Roman
Empire](Western_Roman_Empire "Western Roman Empire"){.wikilink} in part
because of the increasing pressure from threats during the [Barbarian
Invasions](Barbarian_Invasions "Barbarian Invasions"){.wikilink}. From
the 6th century into the 7th century, the
[Slavs](South_Slavs "Slavs"){.wikilink} crossed the
[Danube](Danube "Danube"){.wikilink} and largely absorbed the indigenous
Greeks, Illyrians and Thracians in the
[Balkans](Balkans "Balkans"){.wikilink}; thus, the Illyrians were
mentioned for the last time in historical records in the 7th
century.[^37][^38]

In the 11th century, the [Great
Schism](Great_Schism_of_1054 "Great Schism"){.wikilink} formalised the
break of communion between the [Eastern
Orthodox](Eastern_Orthodox_Church "Eastern Orthodox"){.wikilink} and
[Western Catholic
Church](Western_Catholic_Church "Western Catholic Church"){.wikilink}
that is reflected in Albania through the emergence of a Catholic north
and Orthodox south. The Albanian people inhabited the west of [Lake
Ochrida](Lake_Ochrida "Lake Ochrida"){.wikilink} and the upper valley of
[River Shkumbin](Shkumbin "River Shkumbin"){.wikilink} and established
the [Principality of
Arbanon](Principality_of_Arbanon "Principality of Arbanon"){.wikilink}
in 1190 under the leadership of [Progon of
Kruja](Progon_of_Kruja "Progon of Kruja"){.wikilink}.[^39] The realm was
succeeded by his sons [Gjin](Gjin_Progoni "Gjin"){.wikilink} and
Dhimitri.

Upon the death of Dhimiter, the territory came under the rule of the
Albanian-Greek [Gregory
Kamonas](Gregory_Kamonas "Gregory Kamonas"){.wikilink} and subsequently
under the [Golem of
Kruja](Golem_of_Kruja "Golem of Kruja"){.wikilink}.[^40][^41][^42] In
the 13th century, the principality was dissolved.[^43][^44][^45] Arbanon
is considered to be the first sketch of an Albanian state, that retained
a [semi-autonomous](semi-autonomous "semi-autonomous"){.wikilink} status
as the western extremity of the [Byzantine
Empire](Byzantine_Empire "Byzantine Empire"){.wikilink}, under the
Byzantine [Doukai](Doukas "Doukai"){.wikilink} of
[Epirus](Despotate_of_Epirus "Epirus"){.wikilink} or

Towards the end of the 12th and beginning of the 13th centuries,
[Serbs](Kingdom_of_Serbia_(medieval) "Serb"){.wikilink} and
[Venetians](Venetian_Empire "Venetians"){.wikilink} started to take
possession over the territory.[^47] The
[ethnogenesis](ethnogenesis "ethnogenesis"){.wikilink} of the Albanians
is uncertain; however, the first undisputed mention of Albanians dates
back in historical records from 1079 or 1080 in a work by [Michael
Attaliates](Michael_Attaliates "Michael Attaliates"){.wikilink}, who
referred to the [Albanoi](Albanoi "Albanoi"){.wikilink} as having taken
part in a revolt against
[Constantinople](Constantinople "Constantinople"){.wikilink}.[^48] At
this point the Albanians were fully Christianised.

After the dissolution of Arbanon, [Charles of
Anjou](Charles_I_of_Naples "Charles of Anjou"){.wikilink} concluded an
agreement with the Albanian rulers, promising to protect them and their
ancient liberties. In 1272, he established the [Kingdom of
Albania](Kingdom_of_Albania_(medieval) "Kingdom of Albania"){.wikilink}
and conquered regions back from the [Despotate of
Epirus](Despotate_of_Epirus "Despotate of Epirus"){.wikilink}. The
kingdom claimed all of central Albania territory from
[Dyrrhachium](Dyrrhachium "Dyrrhachium"){.wikilink} along the Adriatic
Sea coast down to [Butrint](Butrint "Butrint"){.wikilink}. A Catholic
political structure was a basis for the papal plans of spreading
[Catholicism](Catholicism "Catholicism"){.wikilink} in the Balkan
Peninsula. This plan found also the support of [Helen of
Anjou](Helen_of_Anjou "Helen of Anjou"){.wikilink}, a cousin of Charles
of Anjou. Around 30 Catholic churches and monasteries were built during
her rule mainly in northern Albania.[^49] Internal power struggles
within the Byzantine Empire in the 14th century enabled Serbs\' most
powerful medieval ruler, [Stefan
Dusan](Stefan_Dusan "Stefan Dusan"){.wikilink}, to establish a
[short-lived empire](Serbian_Empire "short-lived empire"){.wikilink}
that included all of Albania except Durrës.[^50] ![Albanian
principalities, ca. 1390, excluding the [Despotate of
Arta](Despotate_of_Arta "Despotate of Arta"){.wikilink}](Albanian_Principalities,_ca._1390_(modern_Albania).png "Albanian principalities, ca. 1390, excluding the Despotate of Arta")
In 1367, Albanian rulers established the [Despotate of
Arta](Despotate_of_Arta "Despotate of Arta"){.wikilink}. During that
time, several [Albanian
principalities](Albanian_principalities "Albanian principalities"){.wikilink}
were created, notably the [Principality of
Albania](Principality_of_Albania_(medieval) "Principality of Albania"){.wikilink},
[Principality of
Kastrioti](Principality_of_Kastrioti "Principality of Kastrioti"){.wikilink},
[Lordship of Berat](Lordship_of_Berat "Lordship of Berat"){.wikilink}
and [Principality of
Dukagjini](Principality_of_Dukagjini "Principality of Dukagjini"){.wikilink}.
In the first half of the 15th century, the [Ottoman
Empire](Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire"){.wikilink} invaded most of
Albania, and the [League of
Lezhë](League_of_Lezhë "League of Lezhë"){.wikilink} was held under
[Skanderbeg](Skanderbeg "Skanderbeg"){.wikilink} as a ruler, who became
the national hero of the Albanian medieval history.

With the [fall of
Constantinople](fall_of_Constantinople "fall of Constantinople"){.wikilink},
the Ottoman Empire continued an extended period of conquest and
expansion with its borders going deep into [Southeast
Europe](Ottoman_conquest_of_the_Balkans "Southeast Europe"){.wikilink}.
They reached the [Albanian Ionian Sea
Coast](Albanian_Ionian_Sea_Coast "Albanian Ionian Sea Coast"){.wikilink}
in 1385 and erected their garrisons across [Southern
Albania](Southern_Albania "Southern Albania"){.wikilink} in 1415 and
then occupied most of Albania in 1431.[^51][^52] Thousands of Albanians
consequently fled to Western Europe, particularly to
[Calabria](Calabria "Calabria"){.wikilink},
[Naples](Kingdom_of_Naples "Naples"){.wikilink},
[Ragusa](Republic_of_Ragusa "Ragusa"){.wikilink} and
[Sicily](Kingdom_of_Sicily "Sicily"){.wikilink}, whereby others sought
protection at the often inaccessible [Mountains of
Albania](Geography_of_Albania "Mountains of Albania"){.wikilink}.[^53][^54]
The Albanians, as Christians, were considered an [inferior
class](Rayah "inferior class"){.wikilink} of people, and as such they
were subjected to heavy [taxes](Jizya "tax"){.wikilink} among others by
the [Devshirme](Devshirme "Devshirme"){.wikilink} system that allowed
the [Sultan](Sultan "Sultan"){.wikilink} to collect a requisite
percentage of Christian adolescents from their families to compose the
[Janissary](Janissary "Janissary"){.wikilink}.[^55] The Ottoman conquest
was also accompanied with the gradual process of
[Islamisation](Islamisation "Islamisation"){.wikilink} and the rapid
construction of mosques.

A prosperous and longstanding revolution erupted after the formation of
the [League of Lezhë](League_of_Lezhë "League of Lezhë"){.wikilink}
until the [fall of
Shkodër](Siege_of_Shkodra "fall of Shkodër"){.wikilink} under the
leadership of [Gjergj Kastrioti
Skanderbeg](Gjergj_Kastrioti_Skanderbeg "Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg"){.wikilink},
who consistently defeated major Ottoman armies led by
[Sultans](Sultan "Sultan"){.wikilink} [Murad
II](Murad_II "Murad II"){.wikilink} and [Mehmed
II](Mehmed_II "Mehmed II"){.wikilink}. Skanderbeg managed to unite
several of the Albanian principalities, amongst them the
[Arianitis](Arianiti_family "Arianiti"){.wikilink},
[Dukagjinis](Dukagjini_family "Dukagjini"){.wikilink},
[Zaharias](Zaharia_family "Zaharia"){.wikilink} and
[Thopias](Thopia_family "Thopia"){.wikilink}, and establish a
centralised authority over most of the non-conquered territories,
becoming the [Lord of
Albania](Skanderbeg "Lord of Albania"){.wikilink}.[^56] The Ottoman
Empire\'s expansion ground to a halt during the time that Skanderbeg\'s
forces resisted, and he has been credited with being one of the main
reasons for the delay of Ottoman expansion into [Western
Europe](Western_Europe "Western Europe"){.wikilink}, giving the Italian
principalities more time to better prepare for the [Ottoman
arrival](Siege_of_Otranto "Ottoman arrival"){.wikilink}.`{{sfn|Hodgkinson|2005|p=240}}`{=mediawiki}
However, the failure of most European nations, with the exception of
Naples, in giving him support, along with the failure of Pope Pius II\'s
plans to organise a promised crusade against the Ottomans meant that
none of Skanderbeg\'s victories permanently hindered the Ottomans from
invading the Western
Balkans.`{{sfn|Hodgkinson|2005|p=xii}}`{=mediawiki}[^57]

Despite his brilliance as a military leader, Skanderbeg\'s victories
were only delaying the final conquests. The constant Ottoman invasions
caused enormous destruction to Albania, greatly reducing the population
and destroying flocks of livestock and crops. Besides surrender, there
was no possible way Skanderbeg would be able to halt the Ottoman
invasions despite his successes against them. His manpower and resources
were insufficient, preventing him from expanding the war efforts and
driving the Turks from the Albanian borders. Albania was therefore
doomed to face an unending series of Ottoman attacks until it eventually
fell years after his death.[^58]

When the Ottomans were gaining a firm foothold in the region, Albanian
towns were organised into four principal
[sanjaks](sanjaks "sanjaks"){.wikilink}. The government fostered trade
by settling a sizeable Jewish colony of refugees fleeing persecution in
Spain. The city of [Vlorë](Vlorë "Vlorë"){.wikilink} saw passing through
its ports imported merchandise from Europe such as velvets, cotton
goods, mohairs, carpets, spices and leather from
[Bursa](Bursa "Bursa"){.wikilink} and
[Constantinople](Constantinople "Constantinople"){.wikilink}. Some
citizens of Vlorë even had business associates throughout Europe.[^59]

The phenomenon of Islamisation among the Albanians became primarily
widespread from the 17th century and continued into the 18th
century.[^60] Islam offered them equal opportunities and advancement
within the Ottoman Empire. However, motives for conversion were,
according to some scholars, diverse depending on the context though the
lack of source material does not help when investigating such
issues.[^61] Because of increasing suppression of Catholicism, most
Catholic Albanians converted in the 17th century, while Orthodox
Albanians followed suit mainly in the following century.

Since the Albanians were seen as strategically important, they made up a
significant proportion of the [Ottoman
military](Ottoman_military "Ottoman military"){.wikilink} and
bureaucracy. Many Muslim Albanians attained important political and
military positions and culturally contributed to the broader [Muslim
world](Muslim_world "Muslim world"){.wikilink}.[^62] Enjoying this
privileged position, they held various high administrative positions
with over two dozen Albanian [Grand
Viziers](Grand_Viziers "Grand Viziers"){.wikilink}. Others included
members of the prominent [Köprülü
family](Köprülü_family "Köprülü family"){.wikilink}, [Zagan
Pasha](Zagan_Pasha "Zagan Pasha"){.wikilink}, [Muhammad Ali of
Egypt](Muhammad_Ali_of_Egypt "Muhammad Ali of Egypt"){.wikilink} and
[Ali Pasha of
Tepelena](Ali_Pasha_of_Tepelena "Ali Pasha of Tepelena"){.wikilink}.
Furthermore, two sultans, [Bayezid
II](Bayezid_II "Bayezid II"){.wikilink} and [Mehmed
III](Mehmed_III "Mehmed III"){.wikilink}, both had mothers of Albanian
origin.[^63][^64][^65]

```
The [Albanian
Renaissance](Albanian_Renaissance "Albanian Renaissance"){.wikilink} was
a period with its roots in the late 18th century and continuing into the
19th century, during which the Albanian people gathered spiritual and
intellectual strength for an independent cultural and political life
within an [independent
nation](Independent_Albania "independent nation"){.wikilink}. Modern
[Albanian culture](Albanian_culture "Albanian culture"){.wikilink}
flourished too, especially [Albanian
literature](Albanian_literature "Albanian literature"){.wikilink} and
[arts](Albanian_art "arts"){.wikilink}, and was frequently linked to the
influences of the [Romanticism](Romanticism "Romanticism"){.wikilink}
and [Enlightenment](Age_of_Enlightenment "Enlightenment"){.wikilink}
principles.[^66] Prior to the [rise of
nationalism](Rise_of_nationalism_in_the_Ottoman_Empire "rise of nationalism"){.wikilink},
Ottoman authorities suppressed any expression of national unity or
conscience by the Albanian people.

The victory of Russia over the Ottoman Empire following the
[Russian-Ottoman
Wars](Russian-Ottoman_War "Russian-Ottoman War"){.wikilink} resulted the
execution of the [Treaty of San
Stefano](Treaty_of_San_Stefano "Treaty of San Stefano"){.wikilink} which
assigned Albanian-populated lands to their Slavic and Greek neighbours.
However, the [United
Kingdom](United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland "United Kingdom"){.wikilink}
and [Austro-Hungarian
Empire](Austro-Hungarian_Empire "Austro-Hungarian Empire"){.wikilink}
consequently blocked the arrangement and caused the [Treaty of
Berlin](Treaty_of_Berlin_(1878) "Treaty of Berlin"){.wikilink}. From
this point, Albanians started to organise themselves with the goal to
protect and unite the Albanian-populated lands into a unitary nation,
leading to the formation of the [League of
Prizren](League_of_Prizren "League of Prizren"){.wikilink}. The league
had initially the assistance of the Ottoman authorities whose position
was based on the religious solidarity of Muslim people and landlords
connected with the [Ottoman
administration](Ottoman_Porte "Ottoman administration"){.wikilink}. They
favoured and protected the Muslim solidarity and called for defence of
Muslim lands simultaneously constituting the reason for titling the
league [Committee of the Real
Muslims](League_of_Prizren#Formation "Committee of the Real Muslims"){.wikilink}.[^67]

Approximately 300 Muslims participated in the assembly composed by
delegates from Bosnia, the
[administrator](sanjakbey "administrator"){.wikilink} of the [Sanjak of
Prizren](Sanjak_of_Prizren "Sanjak of Prizren"){.wikilink} as
representatives of the central authorities and no delegates from
[Vilayet of
Scutari](Vilayet_of_Scutari "Vilayet of Scutari"){.wikilink}.[^68]
Signed by only 47 Muslim deputies, the league issued the
[Kararname](Kararname_(League_of_Prizren) "Kararname"){.wikilink} that
contained a proclamation that the people from northern Albania,
[Epirus](Epirus "Epirus"){.wikilink} and [Bosnia and
Herzegovina](Bosnia_and_Herzegovina "Bosnia and Herzegovina"){.wikilink}
are willing to defend the [territorial
integrity](territorial_integrity "territorial integrity"){.wikilink} of
the Ottoman Empire by all possible means against the troops of
[Bulgaria](Kingdom_of_Bulgaria "Bulgaria"){.wikilink},
[Serbia](Kingdom_of_Serbia "Serbia"){.wikilink} and
[Montenegro](Kingdom_of_Montenegro "Montenegro"){.wikilink}.[^69]

Ottomans authorities cancelled their assistance when the league, under
[Abdyl Frashëri](Abdyl_Frashëri "Abdyl Frashëri"){.wikilink}, became
focused on working towards Albanian autonomy and requested merging four
[vilayets](Ottoman_vilayet "vilayet"){.wikilink}, including
[Kosovo](Kosovo_Vilayet "Kosovo"){.wikilink},
[Shkodër](Scutari_Vilayet "Shkodër"){.wikilink},
[Monastir](Monastir_Vilayet "Monastir"){.wikilink} and
[Ioannina](Janina_Vilayet "Ioannina"){.wikilink}, into a unified
vilayet, the [Albanian
Vilayet](Albanian_Vilayet "Albanian Vilayet"){.wikilink}. The league
used military force to prevent the annexing areas of
[Plav](Plav_Municipality "Plav"){.wikilink} and
[Gusinje](Gusinje "Gusinje"){.wikilink} assigned to Montenegro. After
several successful battles with Montenegrin troops, such as the [Battle
of Novšiće](Battle_of_Novšiće "Battle of Novšiće"){.wikilink}, the
league was forced to retreat from their contested regions. The league
was later defeated by the Ottoman army sent by the sultan.[^70]

delineated the borders of the country and its neighbors, leaving many
Albanians outside Albania, predominantly
[partitioned](Partition_(politics) "partitioned"){.wikilink} between
[Montenegro](Kingdom_of_Montenegro "Montenegro"){.wikilink},
[Serbia](Kingdom_of_Serbia "Serbia"){.wikilink}, and
[Greece](Kingdom_of_Greece "Greece"){.wikilink}.[^75]

Headquartered in Vlorë, the [International Commission of
Control](International_Commission_of_Control "International Commission of Control"){.wikilink}
was established on 15 October 1913 to take care of the administration of
Albania until its own political institutions were in order.[^76][^77]
The [International
Gendarmerie](International_Gendarmerie "International Gendarmerie"){.wikilink}
was established as the [Principality of
Albania](Principality_of_Albania "Principality of Albania"){.wikilink}\'s
first law enforcement agency. In November, the first gendarmerie members
arrived in the country. Prince of Albania [Wilhelm of
Wied](Wilhelm_of_Wied "Wilhelm of Wied"){.wikilink} *(Princ Vilhelm
Vidi)* was selected as the first prince of the principality.[^78] On 7
March, he arrived in the provisional capital of
[Durrës](Durrës "Durrës"){.wikilink} and began to organise his
government, appointing [Turhan Pasha
Përmeti](Turhan_Pasha_Përmeti "Turhan Pasha Përmeti"){.wikilink} to form
the first Albanian cabinet.

In November 1913, the Albanian pro-Ottoman forces had offered the throne
of Albania to the Ottoman war minister of Albanian origin, [Ahmed Izzet
Pasha](Ahmed_Izzet_Pasha "Ahmed Izzet Pasha"){.wikilink}.[^79] The
pro-Ottoman peasants believed that the new regime was a tool of the six
Christian [Great Powers](Great_Power "Great Power"){.wikilink} and local
landowners, who owned half of the arable land.[^80]

In February 1914, the [Autonomous Republic of Northern
Epirus](Autonomous_Republic_of_Northern_Epirus "Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus"){.wikilink}
was proclaimed in [Gjirokastër](Gjirokastër "Gjirokastër"){.wikilink} by
the local [Greek
population](Greeks_in_Albania "Greek population"){.wikilink} against
incorporation to Albania. This initiative was short-lived, and in 1921
the southern provinces were incorporated into the Albanian
Principality.[^81][^82] Meanwhile, the [revolt of Albanian
peasants](Peasant_Revolt_in_Albania "revolt of Albanian peasants"){.wikilink}
against the new regime erupted under the leadership of the group of
Muslim clerics gathered around [Essad Pasha
Toptani](Essad_Pasha_Toptani "Essad Pasha Toptani"){.wikilink}, who
proclaimed himself the savior of Albania and Islam.[^83][^84] To gain
the support of the [Mirdita](Mirdita "Mirdita"){.wikilink} Catholic
volunteers from northern Albania, Prince
[Wied](Wilhelm_of_Wied "Wied"){.wikilink} appointed their leader, [Prênk
Bibë Doda](Prênk_Bibë_Doda "Prênk Bibë Doda"){.wikilink}, foreign
minister of the Principality of Albania. In May and June 1914, the
International Gendarmerie was joined by [Isa
Boletini](Isa_Boletini "Isa Boletini"){.wikilink} and his men, mostly
from [Kosovo](Kosovo "Kosovo"){.wikilink},[^85] and the rebels defeated
northern [Mirdita](Mirdita "Mirdita"){.wikilink} Catholics, capturing
most of Central Albania by the end of August 1914.[^86] Prince Wied\'s
regime collapsed, and he left the country on 3 September 1914.[^87]

[^89] After [World War I](World_War_I "World War I"){.wikilink}, Albania
lacked an established government and internationally recognised borders,
rendering it vulnerable to neighboring entities such as Greece, Italy,
and Yugoslavia, all of which sought to expand their influence.[^90] This
led to political uncertainty, highlighted in 1918 when the [Congress of
Durrës](Congress_of_Durrës "Congress of Durrës"){.wikilink} sought
[Paris Peace
Conference](Paris_Peace_Conference_(1919–1920) "Paris Peace Conference"){.wikilink}
protection but was denied, further complicating Albania\'s position on
the international stage. Territorial tensions escalated as Yugoslavia,
particularly Serbia, sought control of northern Albania, while Greece
aimed dominance in southern Albania. The situation deteriorated in 1919
when the Serbs launched attacks on Albanian inhabitants, among others in
[Gusinje](Gusinje "Gusinje"){.wikilink} and
[Plav](Plav,_Montenegro "Plav"){.wikilink}, resulting in [massacres and
large-scale
displacement](Plav–Gusinje_massacres_(1912–1913) "massacres and large-scale displacement"){.wikilink}.[^91][^92][^93]
Meanwhile, Italian influence continued to expand during this time,
driven by economic interests and political ambitions.[^94][^95]

[Fan Noli](Fan_Noli "Fan Noli"){.wikilink}, renowned for his
[idealism](idealism "idealism"){.wikilink}, became prime minister in
1924, with a vision to institute a Western-style constitutional
government, abolish feudalism, counter Italian influence, and enhance
critical sectors, including infrastructure, education and
healthcare.[^96] He faced resistance from former allies, who had
assisted in the removal of [Zog](Zog_I_of_Albania "Zog"){.wikilink} from
power, and struggled to secure foreign aid to implement his agenda.
Noli\'s decision to establish diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union, an
adversary of the Serbian elite, ignited allegations of
[bolshevism](bolshevism "bolshevism"){.wikilink} from Belgrade.[^97]
This in turn led to increased pressure from Italy and culminated in
Zog\'s restoration to authority. In 1928, Zog transitioned Albania from
a republic to a monarchy that garnered backing from [Fascist
Italy](Fascist_Italy_(1922–1943) "Fascist Italy"){.wikilink}, with Zog
assuming the title of King Zog I. Key constitutional changes dissolved
the Senate and established a unicameral National Assembly while
preserving Zog\'s authoritative powers.[^98]

In 1939, Italy under [Benito
Mussolini](Benito_Mussolini "Benito Mussolini"){.wikilink} launched a
military invasion of Albania, resulting to the exile of Zog and the
creation of an [Italian
protectorate](Italian_protectorate_of_Albania_(1939–1943) "Italian protectorate"){.wikilink}.[^99][^100]
As [World War II](World_War_II "World War II"){.wikilink} progressed,
Italy aimed to expand its territorial dominion in the Balkans, including
territorial claims on regions of Greece
([Chameria](Chameria "Chameria"){.wikilink}), Macedonia, Montenegro and
Kosovo. These ambitions laid the foundation of [Greater
Albania](Italian_protectorate_of_Albania_(1939–1943) "Greater Albania"){.wikilink},
which aimed to unite all areas with Albanian-majority populations into a
single country.[^101] In 1943, as Italy\'s control declined, [Nazi
Germany](Nazi_Germany "Nazi Germany"){.wikilink} assumed control of
Albania, subjecting Albanians to forced labour, economic exploitation
and repression under [German
rule](German_occupation_of_Albania "German rule"){.wikilink}.[^102] The
tide shifted in 1944 when Albanian partisan forces, under the leadership
of [Enver Hoxha](Enver_Hoxha "Enver Hoxha"){.wikilink} and other
communist leaders, successfully liberated Albania from German
occupation.[^103] `{{Clear}}`{=mediawiki}

![[Enver Hoxha](Enver_Hoxha "Enver Hoxha"){.wikilink} was the founding
leader of communist Albania and its ruler for over four decades,
implementing a regime marked by
[authoritarianism](authoritarianism "authoritarianism"){.wikilink} and
[isolationism](isolationism "isolationism"){.wikilink}](Enver_Hoxha_(portret).jpg "Enver Hoxha was the founding leader of communist Albania and its ruler for over four decades, implementing a regime marked by authoritarianism and isolationism")

The establishment of the [People\'s Republic of
Albania](People's_Socialist_Republic_of_Albania "People's Republic of Albania"){.wikilink}
under the leadership of [Enver
Hoxha](Enver_Hoxha "Enver Hoxha"){.wikilink} was a significant epoch in
modern Albanian history.[^104] Hoxha\'s regime embraced
[Marxist--Leninist
ideologies](Marxism–Leninism "Marxist–Leninist ideologies"){.wikilink}
and implemented
[authoritarian](Authoritarianism "authoritarian"){.wikilink} policies,
including prohibition of religious practices, severe restrictions on
travel, and abolition of private property rights.[^105] It was also
defined by a persistent pattern of purges, extensive repression,
instances of betrayal, and hostility to external influences.[^106] Any
form of opposition or resistance to his rule was met with expeditious
and severe consequences, such as internal exile, extended imprisonment,
and execution.[^107] The regime confronted a multitude of challenges,
including widespread poverty, illiteracy, health crises and gender
inequality.[^108] In response, Hoxha initiated a modernisation
initiative aimed at attaining economic and social liberation and
transforming Albania into an industrial society.[^109] The regime placed
a high priority on the diversification of the economy through
Soviet-style industrialisation, comprehensive infrastructure development
such as the introduction of a transformative [railway
system](Hekurudha_Shqiptare "railway system"){.wikilink}, expansion of
education and healthcare services, elimination of adult illiteracy, and
targeted advancements in areas such as women\'s
rights.[^110][^111][^112][^113]

![[Bunkers in
Albania](Bunkers_in_Albania "Bunkers in Albania"){.wikilink} were
constructed to prevent potential external invasions. By 1983,
approximately 173,371 bunkers were scattered throughout its
territory[^114]](Bunker_in_Albanian_Alps.jpg "Bunkers in Albania were constructed to prevent potential external invasions. By 1983, approximately 173,371 bunkers were scattered throughout its territory")

Albania\'s diplomatic history under Hoxha was characterised by notable
conflicts.[^116] Initially aligned with Yugoslavia as a satellite state,
the relationship deteriorated as Yugoslavia aimed to incorporate Albania
within its territory.[^117] Subsequently, Albania established relations
with the Soviet Union and engaged trade agreements with other Eastern
European countries, but experienced disagreements over Soviet policies,
leading to strained ties with Moscow and diplomatic separation in
1961.[^118] Simultaneously, tensions with the West heightened due to
Albania\'s refusal to hold free elections and allegations of Western
support for [anti-communist
uprisings](Anti-communism "anti-communist uprisings"){.wikilink}.
Albania\'s enduring partnership was with China; it sided with Beijing
during the [Sino-Soviet
conflict](Sino-Soviet_split "Sino-Soviet conflict"){.wikilink},
resulting in severed ties with the Soviet Union and withdrawal from the
[Warsaw Pact](Warsaw_Pact "Warsaw Pact"){.wikilink} in response to the
invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. But their relations stagnated in
1970, prompting both to reassess their commitment, and Albania actively
reduced its dependence on China.[^119]

Under Hoxha\'s regime, Albania underwent a widespread campaign targeting
religious clergy of various faiths, resulting in public persecution and
executions, particularly targeting Muslims, Roman Catholics and Eastern
Orthodox adherents.[^120] In 1946, religious estates underwent
nationalisation, coinciding with the closure or transformation of
religious institutions into various other purposes.[^121] This
culminated in 1976, when Albania became the world\'s first
constitutionally atheist state.[^122] Under this regime, citizens were
forced to renounce their religious beliefs, adopt a secular way of life,
and embrace socialist ideology.[^123][^124]

After four decades of communism paired with the [revolutions of
1989](revolutions_of_1989 "revolutions of 1989"){.wikilink}, Albania
witnessed a notable rise in political activism, particularly among
students, which led to a transformation in the prevailing order. After
the first [multi-party
elections](multi-party_elections "multi-party elections"){.wikilink} of
[1991](Albanian_parliamentary_election,_1991 "1991"){.wikilink}, the
communist party maintained a stronghold in the parliament until its
defeat in the [parliamentary elections of
1992](Albanian_parliamentary_election,_1992 "parliamentary elections of 1992"){.wikilink}
directed by the [Democratic
Party](Democratic_Party_of_Albania "Democratic Party"){.wikilink}.[^125]
Considerable economic and financial resources were devoted to [pyramid
schemes](Pyramid_schemes_in_Albania "pyramid schemes"){.wikilink} that
were widely supported by the government. The schemes swept up somewhere
between one sixth and one third of the population of the
country.[^126][^127] Despite the [International Monetary
Fund](International_Monetary_Fund "International Monetary Fund"){.wikilink}\'s
warnings, [Sali Berisha](Sali_Berisha "Sali Berisha"){.wikilink}
defended the schemes as large investment firms, leading more people to
redirect their remittances and sell their homes and cattle for cash to
deposit in the schemes.[^128]

The schemes began to collapse in late 1996, leading many of the
investors to join initially peaceful protests against the government,
requesting their money back. The protests turned violent in February
1997 as government forces responded by firing on the demonstrators. In
March, the Police and Republican Guard deserted, leaving their armories
open. These were promptly emptied by militias and criminal gangs. The
resulting [civil war](1997_Albanian_civil_unrest "civil war"){.wikilink}
caused a wave of evacuations of foreign nationals and refugees.[^129]

The crisis led both [Aleksandër
Meksi](Aleksandër_Meksi "Aleksandër Meksi"){.wikilink} and [Sali
Berisha](Sali_Berisha "Sali Berisha"){.wikilink} to resign from office
in the wake of the general election. In April 1997, [Operation
Alba](Operation_Alba "Operation Alba"){.wikilink}, a U.N. peacekeeping
force led by Italy, entered Albania with two goals: to assist with the
evacuation of expatriates and secure the ground for international
organisations. The main international organisation involved was the
[Western European
Union](Western_European_Union "Western European Union"){.wikilink}\'s
[multinational](Albanian_civil_war_of_1997#International_intervention "multinational"){.wikilink}
[Albanian Police](Albanian_Police "Albanian Police"){.wikilink} element,

[White Drin](White_Drin "White Drin"){.wikilink}. Of particular concern
is the [Vjosë](Vjosë "Vjosë"){.wikilink}, one of Europe\'s last intact
large river systems.

In Albania [forest cover](forest_cover "forest cover"){.wikilink} is
around 29.% of the total land area, equivalent to 788,900 hectares (ha)
of forest in 2020, up from 788,800 hectares (ha) in 1990. Of the
naturally regenerating forest 11% was reported to be [primary
forest](primary_forest "primary forest"){.wikilink} (consisting of
native tree species with no clearly visible indications of human
activity) and around 0% of the forest area was found within protected
areas. For the year 2015, 97% of the forest area was reported to be
under [public ownership](State_ownership "public ownership"){.wikilink},
3% [private ownership](Private_property "private ownership"){.wikilink}
and 0% with ownership listed as other or unknown.[^156][^157]

Riviera](Albanian_Riviera "Albanian Riviera"){.wikilink}](Gjipe_beach,_Albania.JPG "Gjipe is located on the confluence of the Adriatic and Ionian Sea, on the Albanian Riviera")

The [climate of
Albania](climate_of_Albania "climate of Albania"){.wikilink} exhibits a
distinguished level of variability and diversity due to the differences
in latitude, longitude and altitude.[^158][^159] Albania experiences a
[Mediterranean](Mediterranean_climate "Mediterranean"){.wikilink} and
[Continental
climate](Continental_climate "Continental climate"){.wikilink},
characterised by the presence of four distinct seasons.[^160] According
to the [Köppen
classification](Köppen_climate_classification "Köppen classification"){.wikilink},
Albania encompasses five primary climatic types, spanning from
Mediterranean and
[subtropical](Humid_subtropical_climate "subtropical"){.wikilink} in the
western half to [oceanic](Oceanic_climate "oceanic"){.wikilink},
[continental](Humid_continental_climate "continental"){.wikilink} and
[subarctic](Subarctic_climate "subarctic"){.wikilink} in the eastern
half of the country.[^161] The coastal regions along the
[Adriatic](Albanian_Adriatic_Sea_Coast "Adriatic"){.wikilink} and
[Ionian Seas](Albanian_Ionian_Sea_Coast "Ionian Seas"){.wikilink} in
Albania are acknowledged as the warmest areas, while the northern and
eastern regions encompassing the [Albanian
Alps](Albanian_Alps "Albanian Alps"){.wikilink} and the [Korab
Mountains](Korab_Mountains "Korab Mountains"){.wikilink} are recognised
as the coldest areas in the country.[^162] Throughout the year, the
average monthly temperatures fluctuate, ranging from
`{{convert|-1|°C|°F|lk=on}}`{=mediawiki} during the winter months to
`{{convert|21.8|°C|°F|lk=off}}`{=mediawiki} in the summer months.
Notably, the highest recorded temperature of
`{{convert|43.9|°C|°F|lk=off}}`{=mediawiki} was observed in
[Kuçovë](Kuçovë "Kuçovë"){.wikilink} on 18 July 1973, while the lowest
temperature of `{{convert|-29|°C|°F|lk=off}}`{=mediawiki} was recorded
in Shtyllë, [Librazhd](Librazhd "Librazhd"){.wikilink} on 9 January
2017.[^163][^164]

Albania receives most of the
[precipitation](precipitation_(meteorology) "precipitation"){.wikilink}
in winter months and less in summer months.[^165] The average
precipitation is about
`{{convert|1485|mm|in|abbr=off}}`{=mediawiki}.[^166] The mean annual
precipitation ranges between
`{{convert|600|and|3000|mm|in|abbr=off}}`{=mediawiki} depending on
geographical location.[^167] The
[northwestern](Northern_Mountain_Range_(Albania) "northwestern"){.wikilink}

and [southwestern
highlands](Southern_Mountain_Range_(Albania) "southwestern highlands"){.wikilink}
as well as the [Western
Lowlands](Western_Lowlands "Western Lowlands"){.wikilink} the more
limited amount.[^168] The [Albanian
Alps](Albanian_Alps "Albanian Alps"){.wikilink} in the far north of the
country are considered to be among the most humid regions of Europe,
receiving at least `{{convert|3100|mm|1|abbr=on}}`{=mediawiki} of rain
annually.[^169] Four [glaciers](glacier "glacier"){.wikilink} within
these mountains were discovered at a relatively low altitude of
`{{convert|2000|m|ft}}`{=mediawiki}, which is extremely rare for such a
southerly latitude.[^170]

A [biodiversity
hotspot](biodiversity_hotspot "biodiversity hotspot"){.wikilink},
Albania possesses an exceptionally rich and contrasting
[biodiversity](biodiversity "biodiversity"){.wikilink} on account of its
geographical location at the centre of the [Mediterranean
Sea](Mediterranean_Sea "Mediterranean Sea"){.wikilink} and the great
diversity in its [climatic](climatic "climatic"){.wikilink}, geological
and [hydrological](hydrological "hydrological"){.wikilink}
conditions.[^171][^172] Because of remoteness, the mountains and hills
of Albania are endowed with forests, trees and grasses that are
essential to the lives for a wide variety of animals, among others for
two of the most [endangered
species](endangered_species "endangered species"){.wikilink} of the
country, the [lynx](Balkan_lynx "lynx"){.wikilink} and [brown

Approximately 3,500 different species of plants can be found in Albania
which refers principally to a
[Mediterranean](Mediterranean "Mediterranean"){.wikilink} and
[Eurasian](Eurasia "Eurasia"){.wikilink} character. The country
maintains a vibrant tradition of herbal and medicinal practices. At the
minimum 300 plants growing locally are used in the preparation of herbs
and medicines.[^180] The trees within the forests are primarily
[fir](fir "fir"){.wikilink}, [oak](oak "oak"){.wikilink},

Albania has been an active participant in numerous international
agreements and conventions aimed at strengthing its commitment to the
preservation and sustainable management of biological diversity. Since
1994, the country is a party to the [Convention on Biological
Diversity](Convention_on_Biological_Diversity "Convention on Biological Diversity"){.wikilink}
(CBD) and its associated
[Cartagena](Cartagena_Protocol_on_Biosafety "Cartagena"){.wikilink} and
[Nagoya Protocols](Nagoya_Protocol "Nagoya Protocol"){.wikilink}.[^181]
To uphold these commitments, it has developed and implemented a
comprehensive [National Biodiversity Strategy and Action
Plan](Biodiversity_action_plan "National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan"){.wikilink}
(NBSAP).[^182] Furthermore, Albania has established a partnership with
the [International Union for Conservation of
Nature](International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature "International Union for Conservation of Nature"){.wikilink}
(IUCN), advancing its conservation efforts on both national and
international scales. Guided by the IUCN, the country has made
substantial progress in the foundation of [protected
areas](protected_area "protected area"){.wikilink} within its
boundaries, encompassing 12 [national
parks](national_park "national park"){.wikilink} among others

Climate change is predicted to exert significant impacts on the quality
of life in Albania.[^192] Albania is one of the European countries most
at risk and vulnerable to [natural
disasters](Natural_disaster "natural disasters"){.wikilink}.[^193]
Natural disasters, such as [floods](Flood "floods"){.wikilink}, [forest
fires](Wildfire "forest fires"){.wikilink}, and
[landslides](Landslide "landslides"){.wikilink}, are increasing in
Albania due to climate change, causing significant damage.[^194][^195]
Rising sea levels are anticipated to negatively impact coastal
communities and the tourism industry.[^196]

In 2023 Albania emitted 7.67 million tonnes of [greenhouse
gases](Greenhouse_gas "greenhouse gases"){.wikilink},[^197] equivalent
to 2.73 tonnes per person,[^198] making it a relatively low emitting

Since declaring independence in 1912, Albania has experienced a
significant political transformation, traversing through distinct
periods that included a monarchical rule, a communist regime and the
eventual establishment of a democratic order.[^202] In 1998, Albania
transitioned into a [sovereign](sovereign_state "sovereign"){.wikilink}
[parliamentary](parliamentary_republic "parliamentary"){.wikilink}
[constitutional
republic](constitutional_republic "constitutional republic"){.wikilink},
marking a fundamental milestone in its political evolution.[^203] Its
governance structure operates under a
[constitution](Constitution_of_Albania "constitution"){.wikilink} that
serves as the principal document of the country.[^204] The constitution
is grounded in the principle of the [separation of
powers](separation_of_powers "separation of powers"){.wikilink}, with
three arms of government that encompass the legislative embodied in the
[Parliament](Parliament_of_Albania "Parliament"){.wikilink}, the
executive led by the
[President](President_of_Albania "President"){.wikilink} as the
ceremonial [head of state](head_of_state "head of state"){.wikilink} and
the [Prime
Minister](Prime_Minister_of_Albania "Prime Minister"){.wikilink} as the
functional [head of
government](head_of_government "head of government"){.wikilink}, and the
judiciary with a hierarchy of courts, including the
[constitutional](Constitutional_Court_of_Albania "constitutional"){.wikilink}
and [supreme
courts](Supreme_Court_of_Albania "supreme courts"){.wikilink} as well as
multiple [appeal](Appeals_courts_of_Albania "appeal"){.wikilink} and
[administrative
courts](Administrative_Courts_in_Albania "administrative courts"){.wikilink}.[^205]

Albania\'s legal system is structured to protect its people\'s political
rights, regardless of their ethnic, linguistic, racial, or religious
affiliations.[^206][^207] Despite these principles, there are
significant human rights concerns in Albania that demand
attention.[^208] These concerns include issues related to the
independence of the judiciary, the absence of a free media sector and
the enduring problem of corruption within various governmental bodies,
law enforcement agencies and other institutions.[^209] As Albania
pursues its path towards EU membership, active efforts are being made to
achieve substantial improvements in these areas to align with EU
criteria and standards.[^210]

Emerging from decades of isolation during the communism, Albania has
adopted a [foreign
policy](Foreign_relations_of_Albania "foreign policy"){.wikilink}
orientation centred on active cooperation and engagement in
international affairs. At the core of Albania\'s foreign policies lie a
set of objectives, which encompass the commitment to protect its
sovereignty and territorial integrity, the cultivation of diplomatic
ties with other countries, advocating for [international recognition of
Kosovo](international_recognition_of_Kosovo "international recognition of Kosovo"){.wikilink},
addressing the concerns related to the [expulsion of Cham
Albanians](expulsion_of_Cham_Albanians "expulsion of Cham Albanians"){.wikilink},

[diaspora](Albanian_diaspora "diaspora"){.wikilink}.[^213]

The external affairs of Albania underscore the country\'s dedication to
regional stability and integration into major international
institutions.[^214] Albania became a member of the [United
Nations](United_Nations "United Nations"){.wikilink} (UN) in 1955,
shortly after emerging from a period of isolation during the communist
era.[^215] The country reached a major achievement in its foreign policy
by securing NATO membership in 2009.[^216][^217] Since obtaining
candidate status in 2014, the country has also embarked on a
comprehensive reform agenda to align itself with European Union (EU)
accession standards, with the objective of becoming an EU member
state.[^218]

Albania and Kosovo maintain a fraternal relationship strengthened by
their substantial cultural, ethnical and historical ties.[^219] Both
countries foster enduring diplomatic ties, with Albania actively
supporting Kosovo\'s development and international integration
efforts.[^220] Its fundamental contribution to [Kosovo\'s path to
independence](2008_Kosovo_declaration_of_independence "Kosovo's path to independence"){.wikilink}
is underscored by its early [recognition of Kosovo\'s

displayed by the inaugural meeting in 2014, which serves as an official
platform to enhance bilateral cooperation and reinforce their joint
commitment to policies that promote the stability and prosperity of the
broader Albanian region.[^222]

The [Albanian Armed
Forces](Albanian_Armed_Forces "Albanian Armed Forces"){.wikilink}
consist of [Land](Albanian_Land_Force "Land"){.wikilink},
[Air](Albanian_Air_Force "Air"){.wikilink} and [Naval
Forces](Albanian_Naval_Force "Naval Force"){.wikilink} and constitute
the military and paramilitary forces of the country. They are led by a
[commander-in-chief](commander-in-chief "commander-in-chief"){.wikilink}
under the supervision of the [Ministry of
Defence](Ministry_of_Defence_(Albania) "Ministry of Defence"){.wikilink}
and by the [President](President_of_Albania "President"){.wikilink} as
the supreme commander during wartime. However, in times of peace its
powers are executed through the [Prime
Minister](Prime_Minister_of_Albania "Prime Minister"){.wikilink} and the
[Defence
Minister](Ministry_of_Defence_(Albania) "Defence Minister"){.wikilink}.[^223]

The chief purpose of the armed forces of Albania is the defence of the
independence, the [sovereignty](sovereignty "sovereignty"){.wikilink}
and the [territorial
integrity](territorial_integrity "territorial integrity"){.wikilink} of
the country, as well as the participation in humanitarian, combat,
non-combat and peace support operations.[^224] [Military
service](Military_service "Military service"){.wikilink} is voluntary
since 2010 with the age of 19 being the legal minimum age for the
duty.[^225][^226]

Albania has committed to increase the participations in multinational
operations.[^227] Since the fall of communism, the country has
participated in six international missions but only one United Nations
mission in [Georgia](UNOMIG "Georgia"){.wikilink}, where it sent three
military observers. Since February 2008, Albania has participated
officially in NATO\'s [Operation Active
Endeavor](Operation_Active_Endeavor "Operation Active Endeavor"){.wikilink}
in the [Mediterranean
Sea](Mediterranean_Sea "Mediterranean Sea"){.wikilink}.[^228] It was
invited to join NATO on 3 April 2008, and it became a full member on 2
April 2009.[^229]

Albania reduced the number of active troops from 65,000 in 1988 to
14,500 in 2009.[^230][^231] The military now consists mainly of a small
fleet of aircraft and sea vessels. Increasing the military budget was
one of the most important conditions for [NATO](NATO "NATO"){.wikilink}
integration. As of 1996 military spending was an estimated 1.5% of the
country\'s GDP, only to peak in 2009 at 2% and fall again to 1.5%.[^232]

```
```{=mediawiki}
{{image frame |content={{Albania Labelled Map}} |caption=The [[counties of Albania]] are the first-level administrative units in Albania.}}
```
Albania is defined within a territorial area of
`{{convert|28748|km2|0|abbr=on}}`{=mediawiki} in the [Balkan
Peninsula](Balkan_Peninsula "Balkan Peninsula"){.wikilink}. It is
informally divided into three regions, the
[Northern](Northern_Albania "Northern"){.wikilink},
[Central](Central_Albania "Central"){.wikilink} and [Southern
Regions](Southern_Albania "Southern Region"){.wikilink}. Since [its
Declaration of
Independence](Albanian_Declaration_of_Independence "its Declaration of Independence"){.wikilink}
in 1912, Albania has reformed [its internal
organisation](Administrative_divisions_of_Albania#History "its internal organisation"){.wikilink}
21 times. Presently, the primary [administrative
units](administrative_divisions_of_Albania "administrative units"){.wikilink}
are the twelve constituent
[counties](counties_of_Albania "counties"){.wikilink}
(`{{lang|sq|{{linktext|qarqe|lang=sq}}/{{linktext|qarqet|lang=sq}}}}`{=mediawiki}),
which hold equal status under the law.[^233] Counties had previously
been used in the 1950s and were recreated on 31 July 2000 to unify the
36 [districts](Districts_of_Albania "districts"){.wikilink}
(`{{lang|sq|{{linktext|rrathë|lang=sq}}/{{linktext|rrathët|lang=sq}}}}`{=mediawiki})
of that time.[^234][^235] The largest county in Albania by population is
[Tirana County](Tirana_County "Tirana County"){.wikilink} with over
800,000 people. The smallest county, by population, is [Gjirokastër
County](Gjirokastër_County "Gjirokastër County"){.wikilink} with over
70,000 people. The largest county, by area, is [Korçë
County](Korçë_County "Korçë County"){.wikilink} encompassing
`{{convert|3711|km²|sqmi}}`{=mediawiki} of the southeast of Albania. The
smallest county, by area, is [Durrës
County](Durrës_County "Durrës County"){.wikilink} with an area of
`{{convert|766|km²|sqmi}}`{=mediawiki} in the west of Albania.

The counties are made up of 61 second-level divisions known as
[municipalities](municipalities_of_Albania "municipalities"){.wikilink}
(`{{lang|sq|{{linktext|bashki|lang=sq}}/{{linktext|bashkia|lang=sq}}}}`{=mediawiki}).[^236]
The municipalities are the first level of local governance, responsible
for local needs and [law
enforcement](Law_enforcement_in_Albania "law enforcement"){.wikilink}.[^237][^238][^239]
They unified and simplified the previous system of
[urban](urban_municipalities_of_Albania "urban"){.wikilink} and [rural
municipalities](rural_municipalities_of_Albania "rural municipalities"){.wikilink}
or [communes](Communes_of_Albania "communes"){.wikilink}
(`{{lang|sq|{{linktext|komuna|lang=sq}}/{{linktext|komunat|lang=sq}}}}`{=mediawiki})
in 2015.[^240][^241] For smaller issues of [local
government](local_government "local government"){.wikilink}, the
municipalities are organised into 373 [administrative
units](administrative_units_of_Albania "administrative units"){.wikilink}
(`{{lang|sq|njësia}}`{=mediawiki}/`{{lang|sq|njësitë administrative}}`{=mediawiki}).
There are also 2980 villages
(`{{lang|sq|{{linktext|fshatra|lang=sq}}/{{linktext|fshatrat|lang=sq}}}}`{=mediawiki}),
neighborhoods or wards
(`{{lang|sq|{{linktext|lagje|lang=sq}}/{{linktext|lagjet|lang=sq}}}}`{=mediawiki}),
and localities
(`{{lang|sq|{{linktext|lokalitete|lang=sq}}/{{linktext|lokalitetet|lang=sq}}}}`{=mediawiki})
previously used as administrative units.

the
country.](Toptani_Shopping_Mall_Tirana_2016.jpg "Tirana is the economic hub of the country. It is home to major domestic and foreign companies operating in the country.")

Albania\'s transition from a socialist [planned
economy](planned_economy "planned economy"){.wikilink} to a capitalist
[mixed economy](mixed_economy "mixed economy"){.wikilink} has been
largely successful.[^246] The country has a
[developing](Developing_country "developing"){.wikilink} mixed economy
classified by the [World Bank](World_Bank "World Bank"){.wikilink} as an
[upper-middle income
economy](List_of_countries_by_GNI_(nominal,_Atlas_method)_per_capita#Upper-middle-income_group "upper-middle income economy"){.wikilink}.
In 2016, it had the fourth-lowest [unemployment
rate](List_of_countries_by_unemployment_rate "unemployment rate"){.wikilink}
in the [Balkans](Balkans "Balkans"){.wikilink} with an estimated value
of 14.7%. Its largest trading partners are Italy, Greece, China, Spain,
Kosovo and the United States. The [lek](Albanian_lek "lek"){.wikilink}
(ALL) is the country\'s currency and is
[pegged](Fixed_exchange_rate "pegged"){.wikilink} at approximately
132.51 lek per euro.

The cities of [Tirana](Tirana "Tirana"){.wikilink} and
[Durrës](Durrës "Durrës"){.wikilink} constitute the economic and
financial heart of Albania due to their high population, modern
infrastructure and strategic geographical location. The country\'s most
important infrastructure facilities take course through both of the
cities, connecting the north to the south as well as the west to the
east. Among the largest
[companies](List_of_companies_of_Albania "companies"){.wikilink} are the
energy distribution public company
[OSHEE](Operatori_i_Shpërndarjes_së_Energjisë_Elektrike "OSHEE"){.wikilink},
steel producer Kurum, oil cdompanies like Kastrati,
[Albpetrol](Albpetrol "Albpetrol"){.wikilink}, and
[ARMO](ARMO_oil_refiner "ARMO"){.wikilink}, the mineral
[AlbChrome](AlbChrome "AlbChrome"){.wikilink}, the investment [BALFIN
Group](Samir_Mane "BALFIN Group"){.wikilink} and the telecommunications
companies [One Albania](Albtelecom "One Albania"){.wikilink} and
[Vodafone](Vodafone_Albania "Vodafone"){.wikilink}.[^247]

In 2012, Albania\'s [GDP per
capita](GDP_per_capita "GDP per capita"){.wikilink} stood at 30% of the
[European Union](European_Union "European Union"){.wikilink} average,
while [GDP (PPP) per
capita](GDP_(PPP)_per_capita "GDP (PPP) per capita"){.wikilink} was
35%.[^248] In the first quarter of 2010, after the [Great
Recession](Great_Recession "Great Recession"){.wikilink}, Albania was
one of three countries in Europe to record economic growth.[^249][^250]
The [International Monetary
Fund](International_Monetary_Fund "International Monetary Fund"){.wikilink}
predicted 2.6% growth for Albania in 2010 and 3.2% in 2011.[^251]
According to *[Forbes](Forbes "Forbes"){.wikilink}*,
`{{as of|2016|December|lc=y}}`{=mediawiki}, the [Gross Domestic Product
(GDP)](Gross_Domestic_Product_(GDP) "Gross Domestic Product (GDP)"){.wikilink}
was growing at 2.8%. The country had a [trade
balance](trade_balance "trade balance"){.wikilink} of −9.7% and
[unemployment rate](unemployment_rate "unemployment rate"){.wikilink} of
14.7%.[^252] [Foreign direct
investment](Foreign_direct_investment "Foreign direct investment"){.wikilink}
has increased significantly in recent years as the government has
embarked on an ambitious programme to improve the business climate
through fiscal and legislative reforms.

```
![Grapes in [Berat](Berat "Berat"){.wikilink}. Due to the [Mediterranean

[wine](Albanian_wine "wine"){.wikilink},
[olives](olive "olive"){.wikilink} and [citrus
fruits](citrus_fruit "citrus fruit"){.wikilink} are mostly produced in
Southern
Albania.](Berat_kale_-_panoramio.jpg "Grapes in Berat. Due to the Mediterranean climate, wine, olives and citrus fruits are mostly produced in Southern Albania.")

Agriculture in the country is based on small to medium-sized
family-owned dispersed units. It remains a significant sector of the
[economy of
Albania](economy_of_Albania "economy of Albania"){.wikilink}. It employs
41%[^253] of the population, and about 24.31% of the land is used for
agricultural purposes. One of the earliest farming sites in Europe has
been found in the southeast of the country.[^254] As part of the
pre-accession process of Albania to the [European
Union](European_Union "European Union"){.wikilink}, farmers are being
aided through
[IPA](Instrument_for_Pre-Accession_Assistance "IPA"){.wikilink} funds to
improve Albanian agriculture standards.[^255]

Albania produces significant amounts of fruits (apples,
[olives](olive "olive"){.wikilink}, grapes, oranges, lemons,
[apricots](apricot "apricot"){.wikilink},
[peaches](peach "peach"){.wikilink},
[cherries](Cherry "cherries"){.wikilink},

[honey](honey "honey"){.wikilink}, [dairy
products](dairy_product "dairy product"){.wikilink}, traditional
medicine and [aromatic
plants](Essential_oil "aromatic plants"){.wikilink}. Further, the
country is a worldwide significant producer of
[salvia](salvia "salvia"){.wikilink},
[rosemary](rosemary "rosemary"){.wikilink} and [yellow
gentian](Gentiana_lutea "yellow gentian"){.wikilink}.[^256] The
country\'s proximity to the [Ionian
Sea](Ionian_Sea "Ionian Sea"){.wikilink} and the [Adriatic
Sea](Adriatic_Sea "Adriatic Sea"){.wikilink} give the underdeveloped
fishing industry great potential. The [World
Bank](World_Bank "World Bank"){.wikilink} and [European
Community](European_Community "European Community"){.wikilink}
economists report that, Albania\'s fishing industry has good potential
to generate export earnings because prices in the nearby Greek and
Italian markets are many times higher than those in the Albanian market.
The fish available off the coasts of the country are
[carp](carp "carp"){.wikilink}, [trout](trout "trout"){.wikilink}, [sea
bream](sea_bream "sea bream"){.wikilink},
[mussels](mussel "mussel"){.wikilink} and
[crustaceans](crustacean "crustacean"){.wikilink}.

Albania has one of Europe\'s longest histories of
[viticulture](viticulture "viticulture"){.wikilink}.[^257] Today\'s
region was one of the few places where vine was naturally grown during
the ice age. The oldest found seeds in the region are 4,000 to 6,000
years old.[^258] In 2009, the nation produced an estimated 17,500 tonnes
of wine.[^259]

Albania\'s secondary sector has undergone many changes and
diversification since the communist regime collapsed. It is very
diversified, from
[electronics](Electronics_industry "electronics"){.wikilink},
[manufacturing](Manufacturing_industries "manufacturing"){.wikilink},[^260]
[textiles](Textile_industry "textiles"){.wikilink}, to
[food](Food_industry "food"){.wikilink},
[cement](Cement_industry "cement"){.wikilink},
[mining](Mining_industry "mining"){.wikilink},[^261] and
[energy](Energy_industry "energy"){.wikilink}. The [Antea
Cement](Antea_Cement "Antea Cement"){.wikilink} plant in
[Fushë-Krujë](Fushë-Krujë "Fushë-Krujë"){.wikilink} is considered one of
the nation\'s largest industrial greenfield investments.[^262] Albanian
oil and gas is one of the most promising, albeit strictly regulated,
sectors of its economy. Albania has the [second-largest oil
deposits](List_of_countries_by_proven_oil_reserves "second-largest oil deposits"){.wikilink}
in the [Balkan
peninsula](Balkan_peninsula "Balkan peninsula"){.wikilink} after
[Romania](Romania "Romania"){.wikilink}, and the largest [oil
reserves](Patos-Marinza_Oil_Field "oil reserves"){.wikilink}[^263] in
Europe. The [Albpetrol](Albpetrol "Albpetrol"){.wikilink} company is
owned by the Albanian state and monitors the state petroleum agreements
in the country. The textile industry has seen an extensive expansion by
approaching companies from the [European
Union](European_Union "European Union"){.wikilink} (EU) in Albania.
According to the [Instituti i Statistikës
(INSTAT)](Institute_of_Statistics_(Albania) "Instituti i Statistikës (INSTAT)"){.wikilink},
`{{As of|2016|lc=y}}`{=mediawiki}, textile production had an annual
growth of 5.3% and an annual turnover of around 1.5 billion euros.[^264]

Albania is a significant minerals producer and ranks among the world\'s
leading [chromium](chromium "chromium"){.wikilink} producers and
exporters.[^265] The nation is also a notable producer of copper,
nickel, and coal.[^266] The [Batra
mine](Batra_mine "Batra mine"){.wikilink}, [Bulqizë
mine](Bulqizë_mine "Bulqizë mine"){.wikilink}, and [Thekna
mine](Thekna_mine "Thekna mine"){.wikilink} are among the most
recognised Albanian mines still in operation.

Coast](Albanian_Ionian_Sea_Coast "Albanian Ionian Sea Coast"){.wikilink}](Ksamil_Albania_._Albanian_Riviera.jpg "The Islets of Ksamil, in the south of the Albanian Ionian Sea Coast")
The [tertiary sector](tertiary_sector "tertiary sector"){.wikilink}
represents the fastest growing sector of the country\'s economy. 36% of
the population work in the service sector which contributes to 65% of
the country\'s GDP.[^267] Ever since the end of the 20th century, the
[banking industry](banking_industry "banking industry"){.wikilink} is a
major component of the tertiary sector and remains in good conditions
overall due to [privatisation](privatisation "privatisation"){.wikilink}
and the commendable [monetary
policy](monetary_policy "monetary policy"){.wikilink}.[^268][^269]

Previously one of the most
[isolated](Isolationism "isolated"){.wikilink} and controlled countries
in the world, [telecommunication
industry](telecommunication_industry "telecommunication industry"){.wikilink}
represents nowadays another major contributor to the sector. It
developed largely through privatisation and subsequent investment by
both domestic and foreign investors.[^270]
[Eagle](Eagle_Mobile "Eagle"){.wikilink},
[Vodafone](Vodafone_Albania "Vodafone"){.wikilink} and [Telekom
Albania](Telekom_Albania "Telekom Albania"){.wikilink} are the leading
[telecommunications service
providers](telecommunications_service_provider "telecommunications service provider"){.wikilink}
in the country.

Tourism is recognised as an industry of national importance and has been
steadily increasing since the beginnings of the 21st
century.[^271][^272] It directly accounted for 8.4% of GDP in 2016
though including indirect contributions pushes the proportion to
26%.[^273] In the same year, the country received approximately
4.74 million visitors mostly from across Europe and the United States as
well.[^274]

The increase of foreign visitors has been dramatic. Albania had only
500,000 visitors in 2005, and an estimated 4.2 million in 2012, an
increase of 740 percent. In 2015, summer tourism increased by 25 percent
from 2014, according to the country\'s tourism agency.[^275] In 2011,
[Lonely Planet](Lonely_Planet "Lonely Planet"){.wikilink} named Albania
as a top travel
destination,[^276]`{{failed verification|date=November 2017|reason=How could a 2011 article talk about 2015? anyway link needs updating}}`{=mediawiki}
while *[The New York
Times](The_New_York_Times "The New York Times"){.wikilink}* placed
Albania as number 4 global tourist destination in 2014.[^277]

The bulk of the tourist industry is concentrated along the
[Adriatic](Adriatic "Adriatic"){.wikilink} and [Ionian
Sea](Ionian_Sea "Ionian Sea"){.wikilink} in the west of the country. But
the [Albanian Riviera](Albanian_Riviera "Albanian Riviera"){.wikilink}
in the southwest has the most scenic and pristine beaches; its coastline
has a considerable length of
`{{convert|446|km|abbr=off}}`{=mediawiki}.[^278] The coast has a
distinctive character, rich in varieties of virgin beaches, capes,
coves, covered bays, lagoons, small gravel beaches, sea caves, and many
landforms. Some parts of this seaside are very clean ecologically,
including unexplored areas, which are very rare within the
[Mediterranean](Mediterranean "Mediterranean"){.wikilink}.[^279] Other
attractions include the mountainous areas such as the [Albanian
Alps](Albanian_Alps "Albanian Alps"){.wikilink}, [Ceraunian
Mountains](Ceraunian_Mountains "Ceraunian Mountains"){.wikilink} and
[Korab](Korab "Korab"){.wikilink} Mountains but also the historical

Transportation in Albania is managed within the functions of the
[Ministry of Infrastructure and
Energy](Ministry_of_Infrastructure_and_Energy_(Albania) "Ministry of Infrastructure and Energy"){.wikilink}
and entities such as the [Albanian Road
Authority](Albanian_Road_Authority "Albanian Road Authority"){.wikilink}
(ARRSH), responsible for the construction and maintenance of the
[highways](Highways_in_Albania "highways"){.wikilink} and
[motorways](motorways_in_Albania "motorways"){.wikilink} in Albania, as
well as the [Albanian Aviation
Authority](Civil_Aviation_Authority_(Albania) "Albanian Aviation Authority"){.wikilink}
(AAC), with the responsibility of coordinating civil aviation and
airports in the country.

The [international
airport](Tirana_International_Airport_Nënë_Tereza "international airport"){.wikilink}
of [Tirana](Tirana "Tirana"){.wikilink} is the premier air gateway to
the country, and is also the principal hub for Albania\'s national [flag
carrier](flag_carrier "flag carrier"){.wikilink} airline, [Air
Albania](Air_Albania "Air Albania"){.wikilink}. The airport carried more
than 3.3 million passengers in 2019 with connections to many
destinations in other countries around
[Europe](Europe "Europe"){.wikilink},
[Africa](Africa "Africa"){.wikilink} and
[Asia](Asia "Asia"){.wikilink}.[^280] The country plans to progressively
increase the number of airports especially in the south with possible
locations in [Sarandë](Sarandë "Sarandë"){.wikilink},
[Gjirokastër](Gjirokastër "Gjirokastër"){.wikilink} and
[Vlorë](Vlorë_International_Airport "Vlorë"){.wikilink}.[^281]

The [highways](Highways_in_Albania "highways"){.wikilink} and [motorways
in Albania](motorways_in_Albania "motorways in Albania"){.wikilink} are
properly maintained and often still under construction and renovation.
The [Autostrada 1](A1_motorway_(Albania) "Autostrada 1"){.wikilink} (A1)
is an integral transportation corridor and the country\'s longest
motorway. It is planned to link [Durrës](Durrës "Durrës"){.wikilink} on
the Adriatic Sea across [Pristina](Pristina "Pristina"){.wikilink} in
Kosovo with the [Pan-European Corridor
X](Pan-European_Corridor_X "Pan-European Corridor X"){.wikilink} in
Serbia.[^282][^283] The [Autostrada
2](A2_motorway_(Albania) "Autostrada 2"){.wikilink} (A2) is part of the
[Adriatic--Ionian
Corridor](Adriatic–Ionian_motorway "Adriatic–Ionian Corridor"){.wikilink}
as well as the [Pan-European Corridor
VIII](Pan-European_Corridor_VIII "Pan-European Corridor VIII"){.wikilink}
and connects [Fier](Fier "Fier"){.wikilink} with
[Vlorë](Vlorë "Vlorë"){.wikilink}.[^284] The [Autostrada
3](A3_motorway_(Albania) "Autostrada 3"){.wikilink} (A3) is under
construction and after its completion will connect
[Tirana](Tirana "Tirana"){.wikilink} and
[Elbasan](Elbasan "Elbasan"){.wikilink} with the Pan-European Corridor
VIII. When all three corridors are completed, Albania will have an
estimated `{{convert|759|km}}`{=mediawiki} of highway, linking it with
all neighboring countries.

[Durrës](Port_of_Durrës "Durrës"){.wikilink} is the busiest and largest
[seaport](seaport "seaport"){.wikilink} in the country, followed by
[Vlorë](Port_of_Vlorë "Vlorë"){.wikilink},
[Shëngjin](Port_of_Shëngjin "Shëngjin"){.wikilink} and
[Sarandë](Port_of_Sarandë "Sarandë"){.wikilink}.
`{{as of|2014}}`{=mediawiki}, it is as one of the largest passenger
ports on the [Adriatic Sea](Adriatic_Sea "Adriatic Sea"){.wikilink},
with annual passenger volume of about 1.5 million. The principal ports
serve a system of ferries connecting Albania with islands and coastal
cities in Croatia, Greece, and Italy.

The rail network is administered by the national railway company
[Hekurudha
Shqiptare](Hekurudha_Shqiptare "Hekurudha Shqiptare"){.wikilink}, which
was extensively promoted by Hoxha. There has been considerable increase
in private car ownership and bus usage while rail use decreased since
the end of communism. A new railway line from Tirana and its airport to
Durrës is planned. The location of this railway, connecting Albania\'s
most populated urban areas, makes it an important economic development
project.[^285][^286]

the largest higher education institute dedicated to the study of
arts](Akademia_e_arteve_Ergys_Veliu_Photography.jpg "The University of Arts is the largest higher education institute dedicated to the study of arts")

In Albania, education is secular, free,
[compulsory](Compulsory_education "compulsory"){.wikilink}, and based on
three levels.[^287][^288] The academic year is apportioned into two
semesters, beginning in September or October and ending in June or July.
[Albanian](Albanian_language "Albanian"){.wikilink} is the [primary
language](primary_language "primary language"){.wikilink} of instruction
in the country\'s [academic
institutions](state_school "academic institution"){.wikilink}.[^289] The
study of a first [foreign
language](foreign_language "foreign language"){.wikilink} is mandatory
and taught most often at elementary and bilingual schools.[^290]
Languages taught in schools are English, Italian, French and
German.[^291] Albania has a [school life
expectancy](school_life_expectancy "school life expectancy"){.wikilink}
of 16 years and a [literacy
rate](literacy_rate "literacy rate"){.wikilink} of 98.7%, with 99.2% for
men and 98.3% for women.[^292][^293]

Compulsory primary education is divided into two levels, elementary and
secondary school, from grade one to five and six to nine,
respectively.[^294] Pupils are required to attend school from the age
six until they turn 16. Upon successful completion of primary education,
all pupils are entitled to attend high schools, specialising in any
field, including arts, sports, languages, sciences, and
technology.[^295]

Tertiary education is optional and has undergone a thorough reformation
and restructuring in compliance with the principles of the [Bologna
Process](Bologna_Process "Bologna Process"){.wikilink}. There are a
significant number of private and public [institutions of higher
education](institutions_of_higher_education "institutions of higher education"){.wikilink}
in Albania\'s major cities.[^296][^297] Tertiary education is organised
into three successive levels, the
[bachelor](Bachelor's_degree "bachelor"){.wikilink},

In 2009, Albania had a fruit and vegetable supply of 886 grams per
capita per day, the fifth-highest supply in Europe.[^309] Compared to
other developed and developing countries, Albania has a relatively low
rate of [obesity](obesity "obesity"){.wikilink}, probably thanks to the
[Mediterranean

{{Main|Science and technology in Albania|Telecommunications in Albania|l1=Technology}}
```
After the [fall of
communism](Fall_of_communism_in_Albania "fall of communism"){.wikilink}
in 1991, human resources in sciences and technology in Albania have
drastically decreased. As of various reports, during 1991 to 2005
approximately 50% of the professors and scientists of the universities
and science institutions in the country have left Albania.[^334] In
2009, the [government](Government_of_Albania "government"){.wikilink}
approved the National Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation in
Albania covering the period 2009 to 2015.[^335] It aims to triple public
spending on [research and
development](research_and_development "research and development"){.wikilink}
to 0.6% of GDP and augment the share of
[GDE](Gross_domestic_expenditure_on_R&D "GDE"){.wikilink} from foreign
sources, including the framework programmes for research of the
[European Union](European_Union "European Union"){.wikilink}, to the
point where it covers 40% of research spending, among others. Albania
was ranked 84th in the [Global Innovation
Index](Global_Innovation_Index "Global Innovation Index"){.wikilink} in
2024.[^336]

Telecommunication represents one of the fastest growing and dynamic
sectors in Albania.[^337][^338] [Vodafone
Albania](Vodafone_Albania "Vodafone Albania"){.wikilink}, [Telekom
Albania](Telekom_Albania "Telekom Albania"){.wikilink} and
[Albtelecom](Albtelecom "Albtelecom"){.wikilink} are the three large
providers of [mobile](Mobile_network_operator "mobile"){.wikilink} and
[internet](internet "internet"){.wikilink} in Albania.[^339] As of the
[Electronic and Postal Communications
Authority](Electronic_and_Postal_Communications_Authority_(Albania) "Electronic and Postal Communications Authority"){.wikilink}
(AKEP) in 2018, the country had approximately 2.7 million active mobile
users with almost 1.8 million active broadband subscribers.[^340]
Vodafone Albania alone served more than 931,000 mobile users, Telekom
Albania had about 605,000 users and Albtelecom had more than 272,000
users.[^341] In [January
2023](List_of_spaceflight_launches_in_January–June_2023 "January 2023"){.wikilink},

```
![Development of the [population of
Albania](Demographics_of_Albania "population of Albania"){.wikilink}
over the last sixty
years](Albania_demography.svg "Development of the population of Albania over the last sixty years")

The demographic statistics of Albania, as revealed by the 2023 census
conducted by the [Instituti i
Statistikave](Institute_of_Statistics_(Albania) "Instituti i Statistikave"){.wikilink}
(INSTAT), indicated a population of 2,402,113, with a notable decline
from the 2,821,977 recorded in the 2011
census.`{{sfn|2023 Albanian census|2024|p=105}}`{=mediawiki}`{{sfn|2011 Albanian census|2012|p=7}}`{=mediawiki}
The decrease in inhabitants began after the disintegration of the
communist regime in Albania and is associated with significant shifts
within the political, economic, and social structure of
Albania.`{{sfn|Population Dynamics|2014|p=25}}`{=mediawiki}`{{sfn|2023 Albanian census|2024|p=114}}`{=mediawiki}
A principal factor in this transition incorporates a decline in
fertility rates coupled with an increase in emigration, both
contributing to persistent demographic changes and
challenges.`{{sfn|Population Dynamics|2014|p=39}}`{=mediawiki} It is
forecast that the population will continue shrinking for the next decade
at least, depending on the actual rates and the level of
migration.[^350] Currently, the population density of Albania is
measured at 83.6 inhabitants per square kilometer with a varied
distribution of inhabitants across different
regions.`{{sfn|2023 Albanian census|2024|p=105}}`{=mediawiki}[^351] The
counties of [Tirana](Tirana_County "Tirana"){.wikilink} and
[Durrës](Durrës_County "Durrës"){.wikilink} showcase substantial
concentrations of people, accounting for about 41% of the overall
demographic of Albania, with 32% residing in Tirana and 9% in
Durrës.`{{sfn|2023 Albanian census|2024|p=117}}`{=mediawiki} Conversely,
more peripheral and rural counties such as
[Gjirokastër](Gjirokastër_County "Gjirokastër"){.wikilink} and
[Kukës](Kukës_County "Kukës"){.wikilink} present significantly lower
population densities, with each aiding 3% to the overall
population.`{{sfn|2023 Albanian census|2024|p=117}}`{=mediawiki}

Historically, the Albanian people have established several communities
in many regions throughout Southern Europe. The [Albanian
diaspora](Albanian_diaspora "Albanian diaspora"){.wikilink} has been
formed since the late Middle Ages, when they emigrated to escape either
various socio-political difficulties or the Ottoman conquest of
Albania.[^352] Following the fall of communism, large numbers of
Albanians have migrated to countries such as Australia, Canada,
Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. Albanian
[minorities](Minority_group "minorities"){.wikilink} are present in the
neighbouring territories such as the west of North Macedonia, the
southeast of Montenegro, Kosovo in its entirety and parts of southern
Serbia. Altogether, the number of ethnic Albanians living abroad is
estimated to be higher than the total population inside Albania. As much
as a third of those born in the country\'s borders now live outside of
it, making Albania one of the countries with the highest rate of
outmigration relative to its population in the world.[^353][^354] In
2022 the birth rate was 20% lower than in 2021, largely due to
emigration of people of childbearing age.[^355]

### Urbanisation

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|List of cities and towns in Albania}}
```
Subsequent to the collapse of communism in 1991, Albania has undergone a
remarkable transformation in its urban landscape, emerging as one of the
fastest urbanising countries in
Europe.`{{sfn|Internal Migration Albania|2014|p=12}}`{=mediawiki}[^356][^357]
At the forefront of this transformation is the
[Tirana](Tirana_County "Tirana"){.wikilink}-[Durrës](Durrës_County "Durrës"){.wikilink}
agglomeration, a densely populated urban corridor situated along the
[western coast of
Albania](Albanian_Coastal_Lowlands "western coast of Albania"){.wikilink}.[^358]
This corridor has become the primary locus of population growth and
settlement development, attracting a significant influx of internal
migrants from the country\'s peripheral areas.[^359] Despite an overall
decline of the country\'s total population, the proportion of the urban
demographic has consistently progressed from 47% in 2001 to 65% in
2023.`{{sfn|2023 Albanian census|2024|p=114}}`{=mediawiki}`{{sfn|2011 Albanian census|2012|p=10}}`{=mediawiki}[^360]
This sustained increase, coupled with the concentration in the
Tirana-Durrës region, has led to a spread of regional imbalances, with
the peripheral areas, particularly
[Dibër](Dibër_County "Dibër"){.wikilink} and
[Kukës](Kukës_County "Kukës"){.wikilink}, experiencing severe
depopulation.`{{sfn|Internal Migration Albania|2014|pp=12 & 18}}`{=mediawiki}`{{sfn|Internal Migration Albania|2014|p=15}}`{=mediawiki}`{{sfn|2023 Albanian census|2024|p=117}}`{=mediawiki}

The [official
language](official_language "official language"){.wikilink} of the
country is [Albanian](Albanian_language "Albanian"){.wikilink} which is
spoken by the vast majority of the country\'s population.[^361] Its
standard spoken and written form is revised and merged from the two main
dialects, [Gheg](Gheg "Gheg"){.wikilink} and
[Tosk](Tosk_Albanian "Tosk"){.wikilink}, though it is notably based more
on the Tosk dialect. The [Shkumbin](Shkumbin "Shkumbin"){.wikilink}
river is the rough dividing line between the two dialects. Among
minority languages, [Greek](Greek_language "Greek"){.wikilink} is the
second most-spoken language in the country, with 0.5 to 3% of the
population speaking it as first language, mainly in the country\'s south
where its speakers are concentrated.[^362][^363][^364][^365] Other
languages spoken by ethnic minorities in Albania include
[Aromanian](Aromanian_language "Aromanian"){.wikilink},

population census, 2,765,610 or 98.8% of the population declared
[Albanian](Albanian_language "Albanian"){.wikilink} as their [mother
tongue](mother_tongue "mother tongue"){.wikilink}.[^367] Because of
large migration flows from Albania, over half of Albanians during their
life learn a second language. The main foreign language known is English
with 40.0%, followed by Italian with 27.8% and Greek with 22.9%. The
English speakers were mostly young people, the knowledge of Italian is
stable in every age group, while there is a decrease of the speakers of
Greek in the youngest group.[^368]

Among young people aged 25 or less, English, German and Turkish have
seen rising interest after 2000. Italian and French have had a stable
interest, while Greek has lost much of its previous interest. The trends
are linked with cultural and economic factors.[^369]

Young people have shown a growing interest in the [German
language](German_language "German language"){.wikilink} in recent
years.`{{Citation needed|date=June 2023}}`{=mediawiki} Some of them go
to Germany for studying or various experiences. Albania and Germany have
agreements for cooperating in helping young people of the two countries
know both cultures better.[^370] Due to a sharp rise in economic
relations with Turkey, interest in learning Turkish, in particular among
young people, has been growing on a yearly basis.[^371]

Aromanian, Greek, Macedonian, Montenegrin, Serb, Roma, Egyptian, Bosnian
and Bulgarian peoples, as well as Gorani and Jews as other minority
groups.[^372][^373] The 2023 census recorded the ethnic composition as

population of
2,402,113.`{{sfn|2023 Albanian census|2024|p=75}}`{=mediawiki}

Contrary to official statistics that show an Albanian majority, the
minority groups have frequently disputed the official numbers, asserting
a higher percentage of the country\'s population. The Greek government
claimed there were an estimation of 300,000 ethnic Greeks in
Albania.[^374]`{{cite book|title=RFE/RL Research Report: Weekly Analyses from the RFE/RL Research Institute|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RxgkAQAAIAAJ|year=1993|publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Incorporated|quote=Albanian officials alleged that the priest was promoting irredentist sentiments among Albania's Greek minority&nbsp;– estimated at between 60,000 and 300,000.}}`{=mediawiki}

[^375][^376][^377][^378] The [CIA World

Albania is a [secular](secular_state "secular"){.wikilink} and
religiously diverse country with no [official
religion](official_religion "official religion"){.wikilink}. [Freedom of
religion](Freedom_of_religion "Freedom of religion"){.wikilink},

guaranteed under the country\'s
[constitution](Constitution_of_Albania "constitution"){.wikilink}.[^382]
As of the 2023 Census, there were 1,101,718 (45.86%) [Sunni
Muslims](Sunni_Islam "Sunni Muslims"){.wikilink}, 201,530 (8.38%)
[Catholics](Roman_Catholicism "Catholics"){.wikilink}, 173,645 (7.22%)

nevertheless ranked among the least religious countries in the
world.[^383] Religion constitute an important role in the lives of only
39% of the country\'s population.[^384] In another report, 56%
considered themselves religious, 30% considered themselves
non-religious, while 9% defined themselves as convinced atheists. 80%
believed in God.[^385]

The [Muslim Albanians](Islam_in_Albania "Muslim Albanians"){.wikilink}
are spread throughout the country.
[Orthodox](Orthodoxy_in_Albania "Orthodox"){.wikilink} and
[Bektashis](Bektashi "Bektashi"){.wikilink} are mostly found in the
south, whereas [Catholics](Catholicism_in_Albania "Catholic"){.wikilink}
mainly live in the north.[^386] In 2008, there were 694
[Catholic](Catholic "Catholic"){.wikilink} churches and 425
[orthodox](Eastern_Orthodox_Church "orthodox"){.wikilink} churches, 568
mosques and 70 [bektashi](Bektashi_Order "bektashi"){.wikilink}

During [modern times](Modern_history "modern times"){.wikilink}, the
Albanian republican, monarchic and later communist regimes followed a
systematic policy of separating religion from official functions and
cultural life. The country has never had an [official
religion](official_religion "official religion"){.wikilink} either as a
republic or as a kingdom. In the 20th century, the clergy of all faiths
was weakened under the monarchy and ultimately eradicated during the
1950s and 1960s, under the state policy of obliterating all organised
religion from the territories of Albania. The [communist
regime](Communism_in_Albania "communist regime"){.wikilink} persecuted
and suppressed religious observance and institutions and entirely
[banned religion](anti-religious "banned religion"){.wikilink}. The
country was then officially declared to be the world\'s first [atheist
state](atheist_state "atheist state"){.wikilink}. Religious freedom has
returned, however, since the [end of
communism](Fall_of_communism_in_Albania "end of communism"){.wikilink}.

Islam survived communist era persecution and reemerged in the modern era
as a practised religion in Albania.[^389] Some smaller Christian sects
in Albania include
[Evangelicals](Evangelicalism "Evangelicals"){.wikilink} and several
[Protestant](Protestant "Protestant"){.wikilink} communities including
[Seventh-day Adventist
Church](Seventh-day_Adventist_Church "Seventh-day Adventist Church"){.wikilink},
[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints](The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints "Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints"){.wikilink}
and [Jehovah\'s
Witnesses](Jehovah's_Witnesses "Jehovah's Witnesses"){.wikilink}.[^390][^391][^392][^393]
The first recorded Protestant of Albania was Said Toptani, who travelled
around Europe and returned to [Tirana](Tirana "Tirana"){.wikilink} in
1853, where he preached
[Protestantism](Protestantism "Protestantism"){.wikilink}. The first
[evangelical
Protestants](evangelical_Protestants "evangelical Protestants"){.wikilink}
appeared in the 19th century and the Evangelical Alliance was founded in
1892. Nowadays, it has 160 member congregations from different
Protestant denominations. Following mass emigration to Israel after the
fall of communism, there are only 200 Albanian
[Jews](Judaism_in_Albania "Jews"){.wikilink} left in the
country.[^394][^395] `{{Clear}}`{=mediawiki}

```
![The [helmet](Arms_of_Skanderbeg "helmet"){.wikilink} of [Gjergj
Kastrioti
Skanderbeg](Skanderbeg "Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg"){.wikilink} stands
as an emblem of Albanian
independence](Casque_Skanderbeg_Vienne.jpg "The helmet of Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg stands as an emblem of Albanian independence")

The red and black [national
colours](national_colours "national colours"){.wikilink} are displayed
on the [flag of Albania](flag_of_Albania "flag of Albania"){.wikilink}
that is adorned with a [double-headed
eagle](double-headed_eagle "double-headed eagle"){.wikilink} as the
foremost recognised [national symbol of
Albania](National_symbols_of_Albania "national symbol of Albania"){.wikilink}.[^396][^397][^398]
With the black eagle portraying bravery and strength, the red field
symbolises the fortitude and sacrifices of the Albanian people.[^399]
The eagle is linked with the legacy of the national hero [Gjergj
Kastrioti](Skanderbeg "Gjergj Kastrioti"){.wikilink}, renowned as
Skanderbeg, who led a prosperous [resistance
movement](Skanderbeg's_rebellion "resistance movement"){.wikilink}
against Ottoman rule.[^400][^401][^402] Rooted in the Middle Ages, it
emerged as a [heraldic](Albanian_heraldry "heraldic"){.wikilink}
[symbol](Armorial_of_Albania "symbol"){.wikilink} in the [Principality
of Arbër](Principality_of_Arbanon "Principality of Arbër"){.wikilink}
and among notable Albanian dynasties such as the
[Dukagjini](Dukagjini_family "Dukagjini"){.wikilink},
[Kastrioti](Kastrioti_family "Kastrioti"){.wikilink},
[Muzaka](Muzaka_family "Muzaka"){.wikilink} and
[Thopia](Thopia_family "Thopia"){.wikilink} clans.[^403] Amid the
[Albanian
Renaissance](Albanian_National_Awakening "Albanian Renaissance"){.wikilink},
marking the resurgence of Albanian national identity and aspirations for
independence, the Albanian eagle regained its prominence.[^404] Its
importance reached its culmination with [Albania\'s declaration of
independence](Albanian_Declaration_of_Independence "Albania's declaration of independence"){.wikilink}
in 1912, when [Ismail Qemali](Ismail_Qemali "Ismail Qemali"){.wikilink}
raised it as the national flag in
[Vlorë](Vlorë "Vlorë"){.wikilink}.[^405]

The [coat of arms of
Albania](coat_of_arms_of_Albania "coat of arms of Albania"){.wikilink}
is an adaptation of the flag of Albania and the seal of
Skanderbeg.[^406] The coat comprises the black double-headed eagle
positioned at the centre of a red field.[^407] Above the eagle, it
carries the [helmet of
Skanderbeg](Arms_of_Skanderbeg "helmet of Skanderbeg"){.wikilink} that
is crowned with the head of a golden horned goat.[^408]
`{{lang|sq|[[Ti Shqipëri, më jep nder, më jep emrin Shqipëtar]]|i=no}}`{=mediawiki},
which translates to \"You Albania, give me honour, give me the name
Albanian\", is the [national motto of
Albania](List_of_national_mottos "national motto of Albania"){.wikilink}.[^409][^410]
It finds its foundation in the legacy of [national
poet](national_poet "national poet"){.wikilink} [Naim
Frashëri](Naim_Frashëri "Naim Frashëri"){.wikilink}, who held a renowned
role during the Albanian Renaissance.[^411] The [national anthem of
Albania](national_anthem "national anthem of Albania"){.wikilink},
\"`{{lang|sq|[[Himni i Flamurit]]|i=no}}`{=mediawiki}\", was composed by
[Asdreni](Aleksandër_Stavre_Drenova "Asdreni"){.wikilink} and adopted as
such following Albania\'s independence in 1912.[^412]

### Clothing

```{=mediawiki}
{{Main|Albanian national clothing|l1=Albanian traditional clothing}}
```
![The [Fustanella](Fustanella "Fustanella"){.wikilink} is designated as
the [national costume of

with profound cultural significance within Albanian
culture](Les_Danseurs_Albanais_by_Alexandre-Gabriel_Decamps_(c._1835).jpg "The Fustanella is designated as the national costume of Albania with profound cultural significance within Albanian culture")

[Albanian traditional
clothing](Albanian_national_clothing "Albanian traditional clothing"){.wikilink},
with its contrasting variations for the northern
[Gheg](Ghegs "Gheg"){.wikilink} and southern [Tosk
Albanians](Tosks "Tosk Albanians"){.wikilink}, is a testament to
Albania\'s history, cultural diversity and ethnic identity.[^413] Gheg
men wear a light-colored shirt paired with wide loose-fitting trousers
referred to as the Tirq. These trousers are securely fastened by a wide
woven belt, the Brez. An integral component of their costume is the
[Xhamadan](Xhamadan "Xhamadan"){.wikilink}, a woolen red velvet vest
adorned with folkloric motifs and gold patterns.[^414] They also wear a
distinctive dome-shaped hat known as the
[Qeleshe](Qeleshe "Qeleshe"){.wikilink}, crafted from wool, with its
origins tracing back to the
[Illyrians](Illyrians "Illyrians"){.wikilink}.[^415][^416] Conversely,
Tosk men opt for the [Fustanella](Fustanella "Fustanella"){.wikilink}, a
knee-length garment designated as the national costume, typically white
with pleats, accompanied by a white shirt. They also wear a beige or
dark blue Xhamadan reminiscent of the Gheg attire. To complete their
attire, men wear knee-high socks referred to as
[Çorape](Çorape "Çorape"){.wikilink} and leather shoes known as
[Opinga](Opinga "Opinga"){.wikilink}.

The attire of Gheg and Tosk women is renowned for its rich palette of
colors and intricate filigree detailing, displayed across various
components including ear ornaments, finger rings, necklaces, belt
buckles and buttons. Key components include a long, light-toned shirt
paired with an apron, often accompanied by a woolen or felt mantle
referred to as the Xhoka. Additional upper garments, such as the Dollama
or Mintan, may be layered, along with a headscarf known as Kapica or
Shall. A distinctive variation incorporates a pair of aprons, including
the Pështjellak at the rear and the Paranik at the front. Integral to
the traditional attire of Gheg women is the ancient
[Xhubleta](Xhubleta "Xhubleta"){.wikilink}.[^417] Dedicated efforts have
been undertaken to preserve and promote the dress, acknowledging its
significance as an emblem of Albanian heritage.[^418] As a testament to
its importance, the Xhubleta has been inscribed on the
[UNESCO](UNESCO "UNESCO"){.wikilink} [Intangible Cultural Heritage
List](UNESCO_Intangible_Cultural_Heritage_Lists "Intangible Cultural Heritage List"){.wikilink}.[^419]
The distinctive bell-shaped garment is fashioned in black and enriched
with embroidered ethnic Albanian motifs, showcasing the remarkable
craftsmanship of northern Albania.[^420] Its crafting process involves
multiple intricate stages, encompassing the preparation of shajak fabric
and the precise cutting techniques.[^421] `{{Clear}}`{=mediawiki}

### Art and architecture {#art_and_architecture}

1992](Amphitheatre_of_Butrint_2009.jpg "Butrint has been included in the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites since 1992")

The [artistic history](Albanian_art "artistic history"){.wikilink} of
Albania has been particularly influenced by a multitude of ancient and
medieval [people](Civilisation "people"){.wikilink}, traditions and
religions. It covers a broad spectrum with mediums and disciplines that
include painting, [pottery](pottery "pottery"){.wikilink}, sculpture,
[ceramics](ceramic "ceramic"){.wikilink} and architecture all of them
exemplifying a great variety in style and shape, in different regions
and period.

The rise of the [Byzantine](Byzantine_Empire "Byzantine"){.wikilink} and
[Ottoman Empire](Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire"){.wikilink} in the
[Middle Ages](Middle_Ages "Middle Ages"){.wikilink} was accompanied by a
corresponding growth in
[Christian](Christian_art "Christian"){.wikilink} and [Islamic
art](Islamic_art "Islamic art"){.wikilink} in the lands of Albania which
are apparent in examples of architecture and mosaics throughout the
country.[^422] Centuries later, the [Albanian
Renaissance](Albanian_Renaissance "Albanian Renaissance"){.wikilink}
proved crucial to the emancipation of the modern Albanian culture and
saw unprecedented developments in all fields of literature and art
whereas artists sought to return to the ideals of
[Impressionism](Impressionism "Impressionism"){.wikilink} and
[Romanticism](Romanticism_(art) "Romanticism"){.wikilink}.[^423]
However, [Onufri](Onufri "Onufri"){.wikilink}, [Kolë
Idromeno](Kolë_Idromeno "Kolë Idromeno"){.wikilink}, [David
Selenica](David_Selenica "David Selenica"){.wikilink}, [Kostandin
Shpataraku](Kostandin_Shpataraku "Kostandin Shpataraku"){.wikilink} and
the [Zografi Brothers](Zografi_Brothers "Zografi Brothers"){.wikilink}
are the most eminent representatives of Albanian art.

The [architecture of
Albania](architecture_of_Albania "architecture of Albania"){.wikilink}
reflects the legacy of various civilisations tracing back to the
[classical
antiquity](classical_antiquity "classical antiquity"){.wikilink}. Major
cities in Albania have evolved from within the castle to include
dwellings, religious and commercial structures, with constant
redesigning of town squares and evolution of building techniques.
Nowadays, the cities and towns reflect a whole spectrum of various
[architectural
styles](architectural_style "architectural style"){.wikilink}. In the
20th century, many historical as well as
[sacred](Sacred_architecture "sacred"){.wikilink} buildings bearing the
ancient influence were demolished during the [communist
era](Communism_in_Albania "communist era"){.wikilink}.[^424]

[Ancient
architecture](Ancient_architecture "Ancient architecture"){.wikilink} is
found throughout Albania and most visible in
[Byllis](Byllis "Byllis"){.wikilink},
[Amantia](Amantia "Amantia"){.wikilink},
[Phoenice](Phoenice "Phoenice"){.wikilink},
[Apollonia](Apollonia_(Illyria) "Apollonia"){.wikilink},

[Antigonia](Antigonia_(Chaonia) "Antigonia"){.wikilink},
[Shkodër](Rozafa_Castle "Shkodër"){.wikilink} and
[Durrës](Durrës_Amphitheatre "Durrës"){.wikilink}. Considering the long
period of rule of the [Byzantine
Empire](Byzantine_Empire "Byzantine Empire"){.wikilink}, they introduced
castles, citadels, churches and monasteries with spectacular wealth of
visible [murals](mural "mural"){.wikilink} and
[frescos](fresco "fresco"){.wikilink}. Perhaps the best known examples
can be found in the southern Albanian cities and surroundings of
[Korçë](Korçë "Korçë"){.wikilink}, [Berat](Berat "Berat"){.wikilink},
[Voskopojë](Voskopojë "Voskopojë"){.wikilink} and
[Gjirokastër](Gjirokastër "Gjirokastër"){.wikilink}. Involving the
introduction of [Ottoman
architecture](Ottoman_architecture "Ottoman architecture"){.wikilink}
there was a development of mosques and other Islamic buildings,
particularly seen in Berat and Gjirokastër.

A productive period of
[Historicism](Historicism_(art) "Historicism"){.wikilink}, [Art
Nouveau](Art_Nouveau "Art Nouveau"){.wikilink} and
[Neoclassicism](Neoclassicism "Neoclassicism"){.wikilink} merged into
the 19th century, best exemplified in [Korçë](Korçë "Korçë"){.wikilink}.
The 20th century brought new architectural styles such as the modern
[Italian style](Italianate_architecture "Italian style"){.wikilink},
which is present in [Tirana](Tirana "Tirana"){.wikilink} such as the
[Skanderbeg Square](Skanderbeg_Square "Skanderbeg Square"){.wikilink}
and Ministries. It is also present in Shkodër,
[Vlorë](Vlorë "Vlorë"){.wikilink},
[Sarandë](Sarandë "Sarandë"){.wikilink} and
[Durrës](Durrës "Durrës"){.wikilink}. Moreover, other towns received
their present-day Albania-unique appearance through various cultural or
economic influences.

[Socialist
classicism](Socialist_classicism "Socialist classicism"){.wikilink}
arrived during the [communist
era](Peoples_Republic_of_Albania "communist era"){.wikilink} in Albania
after the [Second World
War](Second_World_War "Second World War"){.wikilink}. At this period
many socialist-styled complexes, wide roads and factories were
constructed, while town squares were redesigned and numerous of historic
and important buildings demolished. Notable examples of that style
include the [Mother Teresa
Square](Mother_Teresa_Square_(Tirana) "Mother Teresa Square"){.wikilink},
[Pyramid of Tirana](Pyramid_of_Tirana "Pyramid of Tirana"){.wikilink},
[Palace of
Congresses](Palace_of_Congresses "Palace of Congresses"){.wikilink} and
so on.

Three Albanian [archaeological](Archaeology "archaeological"){.wikilink}
sites are included in the list of [UNESCO World Heritage
Sites](UNESCO_World_Heritage_Site "UNESCO World Heritage Site"){.wikilink}.
These include the ancient remains of Butrint, the medieval [Historic

Throughout the centuries, [Albanian
cuisine](Albanian_cuisine "Albanian cuisine"){.wikilink} has been widely
influenced by [Albanian
culture](Albanian_culture "Albanian culture"){.wikilink},
[geography](Geography_of_Albania "geography"){.wikilink} and
[history](History_of_Albania "history"){.wikilink}, and as such,
different parts of the country enjoy specific [regional
cuisines](regional_cuisine "regional cuisine"){.wikilink}. Cooking
traditions especially vary between the north and the south, owing to
differing [topography](topography "topography"){.wikilink} and
[climate](climate "climate"){.wikilink} that essentially contribute to
the excellent growth conditions for a wide array of herbs, fruits, and
vegetables.[^427]

Albanians produce and use many varieties of fruits such as
[lemons](Lemon_(fruit) "lemon"){.wikilink}, oranges,
[figs](Figs_(fruit) "fig"){.wikilink}, and most notably,
[olives](Olive_(fruit) "olive"){.wikilink}, which are perhaps the most
important element of Albanian cooking. Spices and other herbs such as
[basil](Basil_(herb) "basil"){.wikilink},
[lavender](lavender "lavender"){.wikilink},
[mint](Spearmint "mint"){.wikilink},
[oregano](oregano "oregano"){.wikilink},
[rosemary](rosemary "rosemary"){.wikilink}, and
[thyme](thyme "thyme"){.wikilink} are widely used, as are vegetables
such as garlic, onions, [peppers](Bell_pepper "pepper"){.wikilink},
potatoes, tomatoes, as well as [legumes](legume "legume"){.wikilink} of
all types.

With a coastline along the

[Mediterranean Sea](Mediterranean_Sea "Mediterranean Sea"){.wikilink},
fish, [crustaceans](crustacean "crustacean"){.wikilink}, and seafood are
a popular and an integral part of the Albanian diet. Otherwise,
[lamb](Lamb_(food) "lamb"){.wikilink} is the traditional meat for
different holidays and [religious
festivals](religious_festival "religious festival"){.wikilink} for both
[Christians](Christianity_in_Albania "Christians"){.wikilink} and

filled with jam, or chocolate and often eaten during winter.

Coffee is an integral part of the Albanian lifestyle. The country has
more coffee houses per capita than any other country in the world.[^428]
Tea is also enjoyed both at home or outside at cafés, bars, or
restaurants. Çaj Mali ([Sideritis](Sideritis "Sideritis"){.wikilink}
tea) is enormously beloved, and a part of the daily routine for most
Albanians. It is cultivated across Southern Albania and noted for its
medicinal properties. [Black tea](Black_tea "Black tea"){.wikilink} is
also popular.

[Albanian wine](Albanian_wine "Albanian wine"){.wikilink} is also common
throughout the country, and has been cultivated for thousands of years.
Albania has a long and ancient history of wine production, and belongs
to the [Old World of wine producing
countries](Old_World_wine "Old World of wine producing countries"){.wikilink}.[^429][^430]

Albanian folk music is a prominent part of the national identity, and
continues to play a major part in overall [Albanian
music](Music_of_Albania "Albanian music"){.wikilink}. Folk music can be
divided into two stylistic groups, mainly the northern
[Gheg](Gheg_Albanian "Gheg"){.wikilink} varieties, and southern
[Lab](Labëria "Lab"){.wikilink} and
[Tosk](Tosk_Albanian "Tosk"){.wikilink} varieties. Northern and southern
traditions are contrasted by a rugged tone from the north, and the more
relaxed southern form of music.

Many songs concern events from [Albanian
history](History_of_Albania "Albanian history"){.wikilink} and
[culture](Culture_of_Albania "culture"){.wikilink}, including
traditional themes of honour, hospitality, treachery, and revenge. The
first compilation of Albanian folk music was made by two
[Himariot](Himara "Himariot"){.wikilink} musicians, [Neço
Muka](Neço_Muko "Neço Muka"){.wikilink} and Koço Çakali, in Paris,
during their work with Albanian soprano [Tefta
Tashko-Koço](Tefta_Tashko-Koço "Tefta Tashko-Koço"){.wikilink}. Several
[gramophone](Phonograph_record "gramophone"){.wikilink} compilations
were recorded at the time by the three artists, which eventually led to
the recognition of [Albanian
iso-polyphony](Albanian_iso-polyphony "Albanian iso-polyphony"){.wikilink}
as a [UNESCO](UNESCO "UNESCO"){.wikilink} [Intangible Cultural
Heritage](UNESCO_Intangible_Cultural_Heritage_Lists "Intangible Cultural Heritage"){.wikilink}.[^433]

(RTSH). The festival is celebrated annually since its inauguration in

singers including [Vaçe Zela](Vaçe_Zela "Vaçe Zela"){.wikilink} and
[Parashqevi

some as the \"world\'s most acclaimed soprano\".[^436] Albanian opera

![An excerpt from the [Meshari](Meshari "Meshari"){.wikilink} *(The
Missal)* written by [Gjon Buzuku](Gjon_Buzuku "Gjon Buzuku"){.wikilink}
`<small>`{=html}(1555)`</small>`{=html}](Meshari.jpg "An excerpt from the Meshari (The Missal) written by Gjon Buzuku (1555)")

The cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the
development of the [Albanian
language](Albanian_language "Albanian language"){.wikilink} in the area
of church texts and publications. The Protestant reforms invigorated
hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition,
when cleric [Gjon Buzuku](Gjon_Buzuku "Gjon Buzuku"){.wikilink}
translated the [Catholic
liturgy](Catholic_liturgy "Catholic liturgy"){.wikilink} into Albanian,
trying to do for Albanian what [Martin
Luther](Martin_Luther "Martin Luther"){.wikilink} had done for German.
[Meshari](Meshari "Meshari"){.wikilink} (*The Missal*) written by [Gjon
Buzuku](Gjon_Buzuku "Gjon Buzuku"){.wikilink} was published in 1555 and
is considered one of the first literary work of written Albanian during
the Middle Ages. The refined level of the language and the stabilised
orthography must be the result of an earlier tradition of written
Albanian, a tradition that is not well understood. However, there is
some fragmented evidence, pre-dating Buzuku, which indicates that
Albanian was written from at least the 14th century.

Albanian writings from these centuries must not have been religious
texts only, but historical chronicles too. They are mentioned by the
humanist [Marin Barleti](Marin_Barleti "Marin Barleti"){.wikilink}, who
in his book [Siege of
Shkodër](Siege_of_Shkodra_(1478)#The_Book "Siege of Shkodër"){.wikilink}
(*Rrethimi i Shkodrës*) from 1504, confirms that he leafed through such
chronicles written in the language of the people (*in vernacula lingua*)
as well as his famous biography of
[Skanderbeg](Skanderbeg "Skanderbeg"){.wikilink} [Historia de vita et
gestis Scanderbegi Epirotarum
principis](Marin_Barleti "Historia de vita et gestis Scanderbegi Epirotarum principis"){.wikilink}
(*History of Skanderbeg*) from 1508. The *History of Skanderbeg* is
still the foundation of Skanderbeg studies and is considered an Albanian
cultural treasure, vital to the formation of Albanian national
self-consciousness.

![2016 LGBT+ Pride in

Nearly 60% of women in rural areas suffer physical or psychological
violence and nearly 8% are victims of sexual violence. Protection orders
are often violated. In 2014 the Albanian Helsinki Committee (AHC)
reported that the number of female murder victims is still high.[^440]
The Commissioner for Protection from Discrimination has raised concerns
regarding the family registration law that discriminates against women.
As a result, heads of households, who are overwhelmingly men, have the
right to change family residency without their partners\'
permission.[^441]

In 2015, the association
[ILGA-Europe](ILGA-Europe "ILGA-Europe"){.wikilink} ranked Albania 19th
in terms of LGBT rights out of 49 observed European countries.[^442]
Meanwhile, on the latest report in 2022, lack of progress caused Albania
to be ranked the 28th country in Europe, among 49 countries
observed.[^443]
